        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This page explains what you’ll need to become a teacher in England.
        </p>
        <p>
          The routes to teacher training in other parts of the UK are different – learn
          more about teacher training in <a href="https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://teachinscotland.scot/">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.discoverteaching.wales/routes-into-teaching/">Wales</a>.
        </p>



<h2 id="2">Learn more about life as a teacher</h2>
<p>
	If you're considering a career in teaching, the Department for Education’s <a
		href="https://beta-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk">Get
	into Teaching</a> offers an overview of how you can become a teacher.
</p>
<p>
	You’ll find case studies and information about career progression, salaries and
	ways to fund your teacher training.
</p>
<p>
	You’ll also be able to sign up for events, ask questions using online chat or
	phone and get personalised support from a teacher training adviser.
</p>
<h2 id="3">
	What you’ll need to start teacher training
</h2>
<h3>
	Qualifications
</h3>
<p>
	To be eligible to start teacher training, you'll need:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>a degree or equivalent qualification</li>
	<li>grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSEs or to demonstrate a standard equivalent</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To teach at primary school level, you will also need:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>grade 4 (C) or above in GCSE science or to demonstrate a standard equivalent</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not have a degree</h3>
<p>You can study for a degree which includes teacher training and leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). Courses take 1 to 4 years and may include one of these:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bachelor of Education degree (BEd)</li>
	<li>Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<a href="https://digital.ucas.com/search">Search UCAS to find a degree leading
	to </a>Qualified Teacher Status.
</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
  <p>Some private schools accept staff without a degree or QTS.  It’s best to check with the school. </p>
</div>

<h3>If you do not have GCSEs</h3>
<p>You can still apply for teacher training if you do not have English, maths or science (for primary) GCSE qualifications at the right grade.</p>
<p>However, to start your training, you'll need to have demonstrated a standard equivalent to grade 4 (C) at GCSE in these subjects.</p>
<p>We recommend that, when you’ve chosen a training provider, you contact them for advice about getting the right qualification in time for your course.</p>
<p>You should ask if your provider offers or accepts ‘equivalency tests’ (which show that you've reached the same educational level and breadth of knowledge as an English, maths or science GCSE grade 4 (C) or above. Ask if they recommend you do the test or if they will accept other evidence of attainment. </p>
<p>
	You can also visit the <a
		href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/home">National Careers Service</a> to find GCSE courses for people who are over 16 and have left school.
</p>

<h3>
	Health and fitness
</h3>
<p>
	Before you start a teacher training course, your training provider might send
	you a health questionnaire to complete. This confirms you have the fitness and
	physical capacity to train to teach.
</p>
<h3>
	DBS check
</h3>
<p>
	You’ll need an enhanced <a
		href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service">Disclosure
	and Barring Service (DBS)</a> check if you intend to teach students under 18.
</p>

<h3>International candidates with a non-UK degree</h3>
<p>
	Please read our guidance for international candidates about eligibility, visas,
	funding and more.
</p>
<h2 id="4">Financial support for teacher training</h2>
<p>
	The level of financial support you get will depend on the subject you choose and the way you train to become a teacher.
</p>
<p>
	There are several types of funding that may be available to you, depending on your eligibility:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>a bursary
	<li>a scholarship
	<li>student finance</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It’s possible to train while you work as a paid teacher. Find out more about <a href="#salaried">paid routes into teaching</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	Please note that alternative funding is in place to train as an Early Years teacher, which leads to achieving Early Years Status (EYTS).
</p>
<h3>Bursaries and scholarships</h3>
<p>
	Bursaries and scholarships are available for teacher training in certain subjects. A bursary or scholarship is a tax-free sum of money of £6,000 to £28,000.
</p>
<p>
	If you get a bursary or are awarded a scholarship, you won’t have to pay it back. You can get either a bursary or a scholarship, not both.
</p>
<p>
	For some subjects (maths, physics, chemistry and modern foreign languages), you’ll get <a
		href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-career-payments-guidance-for-teachers-and-schools"> early career payments</a> a in addition to a bursary or scholarship. You’ll receive a payment of £2,000 in your second, third and fourth years of teaching (£3 000 in some parts of England).
</p>
<p>
	Bursaries are worth up to £26,000 and awarded:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>if you meet the criteria</li>
	<li>to candidates with a 2:2 or above in their undergraduate degree, a Masters or a PhD</li>
	<li>in priority subjects</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Scholarships are worth up to £28,000 and awarded:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>if your scholarship application is successful</li>
	<li>to candidates with a 2:1 or First in their undergraduate degree, a Masters or a PhD</li>
	<li>in priority subjects</li>
</ul>
<h4>Check which subjects have bursaries and scholarships</h4>
<p>
	Bursaries and scholarships are only available for the subjects listed below. Primary teacher training bursaries are only available if you specialise in maths.

	Ways to train
</h2>
<h3>
	What you’ll need to work as a teacher
</h3>
<p>
	To work as a qualified teacher in state schools in England, you’ll need
	Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
</p>
<p>
	Undergraduate teacher training leading to QTS can take up to 4 years.
</p>
<p>
	Graduate teacher training leading to QTS typically takes one year of full-time study. Some providers offer part-time study, which typically take 2 years.
</p>
<p>
	Once you’ve gained your QTS, you can apply for jobs as a
	newly-qualified teacher (NQT).
</p>
<p>
	NQTs do afurther ‘induction programme’ in school as a paid and qualified teacher, which allows them to build on their initial teacher training.
</p>
<h3>
	Find postgraduate teacher training
</h3>
<p>
	Use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find
	postgraduate teacher training courses</a> to search and compare
	government-approved teacher training providers in your area.
</p>
<p>
	All primary and secondary teacher training courses on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find postgraduate teacher training courses</a> lead to QTS.
</p>
<p>
	You can also search for ‘further education’ courses leading to a post-compulsory
	education and training qualification (PCET). You do not need a degree to apply
	for courses leading to a PCET.
</p>
<p>
	If you are still exploring options, here are some things to consider.
</p>
<h3>Get school experience </h3>
<p>
	Spending time in a school will help you decide if teaching is for you. You will
	learn about different subjects and age groups and get insights and information
	for your personal statement.
</p>
<p>
	The Department for Education now helps candidates find placements in school –
	learn more about <a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/">getting
	school experience</a>.
</p>
<h3>
	Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
</h3>
<p>
	If your undergraduate degree is in a STEM or STEM-related subject, and you are
	still a student, you can apply for a summer teaching internship. For advice, and
	a list of schools participating in STEM internships, visit Get into Teaching.
</p>
<h3>
	What’s the difference between a QTS, a PGCE and PGDE?
</h3>
<p>
	QTS allows you to teach as a qualified teacher in state-maintained schools and non-maintained special schools in England. It may also allow you to teach in other parts of the UK. 
</p>
<p>
	There is information available about teaching in <a href="https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://teachinscotland.scot/">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.discoverteaching.wales/routes-into-teaching/">Wales</a>.
</p>

<h3>
	PGCE (or PGDE) with QTS
</h3>
<p>
	A PGCE (postgraduate certificate in education) with QTS gives you an academic qualification as well as QTS.  Many PGCE courses include credits that count towards a Master’s degree.
</p>
<P>
	A PGCE may allow you to teach in some other countries. If you’re planning to teach overseas, you should always check what’s needed in the country you’d like to teach in.
</P>
<p>
	Some providers offer a PGDE (postgraduate diploma in education) with QTS. In some cases these courses offer more credits towards
	a Master’s degree than PGCE courses.
</p>
<P>
	Use <a
		href="https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/start/subject?l=2">Find postgraduate teacher training</a> training to check and learn more about the content and structure of the courses on offer.
</P>
<H4>
	Further education (PGCE or PGDE without QTS)
</H4>
<p>
	To teach further education you do not need QTS. Instead you can study for a PGCE
	or PGDE without QTS. These courses are also eligible for candidates without a
	degree.
</p>
<h3>
	Choose an age group
</h3>
<p>
	You can train to teach:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>under-fives (also known as ‘early years’)
	<li>primary school children
	<li>primary school with a specialism (for example, English, modern languages or
		science)
	<li>secondary school age children (you’ll need to specialise in a subject)
	<li>further education (14 to adult)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Use <a

</p>
<h3>
	Teaching under-fives
</h3>
<p>
	If you choose to teach under-fives, you’ll need to apply for a specialist
	teacher training course called Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT).
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the course, you’ll gain Early Years Teacher Status and will be
	qualified to teach under-fives only.

</p>
<p>
	Evidence can include:
</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>Subject knowledge enhancement courses</h4>
<p>
	If you’re applying to teach a subject different from that of your degree, your
	training provider may ask you to complete a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE)
	course.
</p>
<p>
	SKE courses can also be helpful if it’s been a while since you studied for your
	degree.
</p>
<p>
	Your training provider will ask you to complete an SKE course as a condition of taking up your offer of a teacher training place if they feel if you need to enhance your subject knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
	You won't have to pay for your SKE course and you may be eligible for a bursary.
</p>
<p>
	Your training provider will decide the course duration (between 8 and 28 weeks. This will depend on the required knowledge you need. 
</p>
<p>
	SKE courses can be completed before or alongside your teacher training and are available to study full-time or part-time, classroom-based or online.
</p>
<p>
	SKE courses are available in:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>biology</li>
	<li>chemistry</li>
	<li>computer studies</li>
	<li>design and technology</li>
	<li>English</li>

<h3>
	Teaching children with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)
</h3>
<p>
	Use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find
	postgraduate teacher training</a> to search for training courses that involve working with SEND children.
</p>
<p>
	Qualified SEND teachers are eligible for an extra payment, on top of their
	annual salary, of between £2,209 and £4,359 a year.
</p>
<h4>Teaching SEND pupils</h4>
<p>You don’t have to take a SEND specialist course. If you want to be a SEND teacher you can apply to teach in a special school if you have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>been teaching for a few years</li>
	<li>experience of managing SEND pupils in your primary or secondary school</li>
</ul>

<h4>Teaching children with sensory impairments</h4>
<p>If you want to teach pupils with hearing, vision or multi-sensory impairments, you’ll need a specific qualification. </p>
<h4>Be a Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo)</h4>
<p>As a SENCo you’ll be responsible for assessing, planning and monitoring the progress of children with SEND. To apply for a job as a SENCo, you’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>be a qualified teacher</li>
	<li>complete the National Award in Special Educational Needs Coordination (NASENCO) when you take up the SENCO post</li>
</ul>

<h3>Training to teach if you have a disability</h3>
<p>Teachers with disabilities make valuable contributions both to classrooms and the culture of schools where they work.
</p>
<h4>Your rights</h4>
<p>
	It is against the law for teacher training providers to discriminate against teacher training candidates with disabilities.Under the Equality Act 2010, providers must make adjustments to help you do a course or go to an interview, providing your requests are reasonable.Examples of support could be:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>organising equipment like a hearing loop or an adapted keyboard
	<li>putting you in touch with support staff if you have a mental health
		condition
	<li>making sure classrooms are wheelchair accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If the help you need is not covered by your provider making adjustments, you
	might also be able to get support from <a
		href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a>. This could include
	a grant to help cover the costs of practical support in the workplace.
</p>
<h4>Telling your training provider about your disability when you apply</h4>
  
  <p>It’s up to you if you want to tell your training
	provider about your disability. The main advantage of doing this is to let them
  put support in place.</p>
  <p>information you give about your
	disability is protected under the <a
		href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act">Data
  Protection Act 2018</a>.</p>
  <h4>Completing a fitness questionnaire</h4>
  <p>If you’re offered a place on a teacher
	training course, you may have to complete a fitness questionnaire before
	starting. Training providers should only ask relevant questions to make sure
  you’re able to teach.</p>
  <h4>Useful resources for disabled candidates</h4>

<h3>
	Types of teacher training provider
</h3>
<p>
	You can do your teacher training on a course run by a university, an individual
	school, or a partnership of schools (sometimes called a SCITT, standing for
	‘school-centred initial teacher training’).
</p>
<p>
	Although the type of institution (school or university) running the course will
	differ, the content of the course will meet national guidelines on teacher
	training.
</p>
<p>
	The primary and secondary teacher training courses listed on <a
		href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find
	postgraduate teacher training</a> all lead to QTS or PGCE/PGDE plus QTS.
</p>
<p>
	The majority of postgraduate teacher training courses are made up of:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>academic study of the theory of teaching (also known as ‘pedagogy’)
	<li>hands-on experience in the classroom</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The course typically lasts a year (3 school terms) and training will usually take place:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>at your training provider's main site
	<li>in school placements organised by your provider</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Details of course structure and location will vary between training providers –
	you can research specific courses on Find postgraduate teacher training.
</p>
<p>
	When you’re researching training providers, bear in mind:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>location – you will need to be able to travel to your academic learning
		location as well as your placement schools
	<li>reputation – check Ofsted’s report on your training provider for more detail
	<li>competition for entry – some providers are tougher than others
	<li>special academic requirements for entry – check the training provider
		listing in <a
			href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find
		postgraduate teacher training</a> to see what class of degree, for example, the
		provider asks for
	<li>size of institution – would you be happier in a large university campus, or
		in a smaller local school setting?
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You can use<a
		href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses"> Find
	postgraduate teacher training</a> to find and compare a shortlist of training
	providers located near to you.
</p>
<h3>
	Paid teacher training
</h3>
<p>
	Under some circumstances, you can train as a teacher ‘on the job’. Places on
	these courses are competitive, but you will:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>earn a salary
	<li>pay no student fees for training towards QTS</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=“salaried”>
	Salaried teacher training courses
</h3>
<p>
	You can apply for a ‘salaried’ teacher training course.There are 3 options available:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>School Direct Salaried (SDS)</li>
	<li>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships</li>
	<li>Teach First</li>
</ul>
	<p>This means you’ll be paid and taxed as an unqualified teacher. The salary awarded will differ between schools – you should check the salary with the school before you apply.
</p>
<p>
	These courses do not offer bursaries, scholarships or student
	finance. There are usually no course fees to pay.
</p>
<p>
	Both the SDS and postgraduate apprenticeship courses will lead to QTS.  If you choose to do a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship, you’ll also have to sit an ‘end point assessment’ (EPA). 
</p>
<p>
	Select ‘only salaried courses’ in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find postgraduate teacher training</a> to find local courses.

<h3>Choosing which service to use for your application</h3>
<p>
	When you search for a course on <a
		href="https://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/">Find
	postgraduate teacher training</a>, you’ll be given a choice about which service
	you’d like to use.
</p>
<h3>
	How many training providers can I apply to?
</h3>
<p>
	During the first round of your application, you should apply to no more than three courses in total, and accept only one offer. This rule applies whether you use UCAS Teacher Training, Apply for teacher training, or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
	We suggest you use Apply for teacher training if:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>all your chosen training providers are available through this new service</li>
	<li>you want to trial a streamlined, modern GOV.UK service</li>
</ul>
<p>

<ul>
	<li>you’ve already started applying via UCAS</li>
	<li>some of your chosen training providers are not available through Apply for
		teacher training and you do not want to use 2 different services

<h3>
	COVID-19
</h3>
<p>
	The impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) means you are likely to experience some
	delays to your application, whether you use UCAS and Apply for teacher training.
</p>
<h3>Preparing to apply for teacher training</h3>
<p>
	The Apply for teacher training service will guide you through the application
	process all the way to enrolment on your course.
</p>
<p>
	However there are things you could start to consider right away.
</p>

<h4>Think about why you want to be a teacher</h4>
<p>As part of the application process, you’ll be asked to tell training
	providers why you want to be a teacher.
</p>
<p>This is one of the most important parts of your application, so it’s worth
	thinking about it in advance. 
</p>
<p>You should use this section to showcase your motivation, commitment and
	teaching potential, backing up your answer with specific examples.
</p>
<p>
	Give providers an insight into your personality by writing honestly and
	thoughtfully. Avoid cliché and write in clear, correct, concise English.
</p>
<p>
	To get help with personal statements from a teacher training adviser, <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/">use the Sign up to talk to a teacher training adviser service.</a>.
</p>
<p>
	You don't have to cover everything in this list, but suggested topics include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>why you want to be a teacher
	<li>your passion for your subject and the age group you’ve chosen to teach
	<li>the welfare and education of children and/or young people
	<li>the demands and rewards of the profession
	<li>personal qualities that will make you a good teacher
	<li>your contribution to the life of the school outside the classroom – for
		example, running extra-curricular activities and clubs
	<li>if you have school experience or have worked as a volunteer with children or
		young people, give details of what this has taught you
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>What do you know about the subject you want to teach?</h4>
<p>
	The application form also asks for detailed evidence for the knowledge and
	interest you bring to the subject(s) you’d like to teach.
</p>
<p>
	See 'Choose a subject’ for more about subject knowledge.
</p>
<h4>Arrange your references</h4>
<p>
	You'll need to supply contact details for 2 referees with your application form. This is a compulsory part of the application process and you will not be able to submit your application without them.
</p>
<p>
	Choose referees who’ll endorse your:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>teaching passion and potential</li>
	<li>suitability to work with children</li>
	<li>academic abilities</li>
	<li>reliability and professionalism</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Suitable referees include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>your current line manager at work</li>
	<li>previous employers</li>
	<li>a teacher at a school where you work or volunteer</li>
	<li>your university tutor or supervisor</li>
	<li>a supplier or client you’ve worked with (if you’re self-employed)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Referees should not be family members, partners or friends. Training providers
	will only accept character references if there’s also an academic or
	professional reference.
</p>
<p>
	If you're applying for a salaried course, one of your references must be from an
	employer.
</p>
<p>
	If you're struggling to find suitable referees, you can:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>contact one of your chosen training providers for advice</li>
	<li><a
		href="https://register.getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/register">Sign up to talk to a teacher training adviser </a>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Attend an interview
</h3>
<p>
	If your application is successful, you’ll be invited for an interview by your
	training provider.
</p>
<p>
	Interviews usually last a day and include an interview and some time spent
	teaching a class of real pupils.
</p>
<p>
	However they vary from provider to provider – you’ll be given all the
	information you need when you’re invited to attend.
</p>

<h3>
	Meet the conditions of your offer
</h3>
<p>
	If your training provider offers you a place, it may come with some conditions.
	For example:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>get an enhanced DBS check</li>
	<li>complete a health questionnaire to determine whether you're fit to train to
		teach
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Other common conditions some candidates may need to meet include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>sitting a GCSE equivalence test</li>
	<li>taking a subject knowledge enhancement course</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Your training provider will help you meet your conditions.
</p>
<h3>
	What to do if you do not get a place
</h3>
<p>
	If your applications to all 3 of the training providers in the first round are
	unsuccessful, or you withdraw your applications, you can apply again.
</p>
<p>
	During this second round of applications, you apply to only one training provider at a time. However, you can apply to as many as you want, sequentially, until the end of the recruitment period.
</p>
<p>
	The recruitment period closes on 3 October 2020 for courses starting in 2020,
	and re-opens a few weeks later for courses starting in 2021.
</p>
<p>
	So if you are unsuccessful, when recruitment reopens for the following year, you can start again, and apply to 3 training providers just as you did in the first round of applications.

<h4>How we’re improving things for teachers</h4>
<p>
	A lot has changed for teachers in England over the last few years. The
	Department for Education is working with schools to:
</p>
<p>
	1. Reduce workload
</p>
<p>
	Teachers, middle leaders and senior leaders reported working <a
		href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/838433/Teacher_workload_survey_2019_brief.pdf">5 hours less per week than they did in 2016</a>.
</p>
<p>
	See how <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reducing-school-workload#department-for-education-policy">teachers are reducing the workload</a>, and using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reducing-workload-in-your-school">workload reduction toolkit</a>.
</p>
<p>
	2. Improve behaviour
</p>
<p>
	The Department for Education has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs">invested £10m through Behaviour Hubs</a> so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with schools that want to improve behaviour.
</p>
<p>
	3. Make it easier for teachers to work flexibly
</p>
<p>
	Schools are  helping teachers <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools">work flexibly</a>.
</p>
<p>
	You can search for jobs with flexible working patterns by using <a href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/"></a>Teaching Vacancies</a>.
</p>
<h4>Getting qualified</h4>
<p>
	You may need to gain <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts">Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)</a>, depending on the type of school you want to work in.
</p>
<p>
	If you're experienced and have a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the assessment only route</a> without any further training.
</p>
<p>
	If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you can get qualified on a <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/postgraduate-teacher-training-courses/teacher-training-courses">teacher training course</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If you are a qualified teacher from the EU, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway or Switzerland, or you have a teaching qualification from the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#teachers-qualified-in-australia-canada-new-zealand-and-the-usa"></a>apply for QTS without further training.</a>.
