We want to make our services easy, useful and reliable. When services
are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small
amounts of information on your computer, tablet, or mobile phone –
whichever device you use to access our site. These include small files
known as cookies.

The information below shows the cookies that are set by
[education.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
and the third-party services we use. At the header and footer of this
page, you can change your preferences at any time for marketing cookies.

### 1. Functional cookies

These functional cookies are strictly necessary cookies, which help to
make your experience on the site as smooth as possible and do not gather
information about you.

Some examples of these cookies include:

  - enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to
    give the same information several times during one task
  - recognising that you may already have given a username and password
    so that you don’t need to do so for every webpage requested
  - measuring how many people are using our services so that we can make
    them easier to use and ensure that there is enough capacity to make
    sure they are fast

### 2. Non-functional cookies

These cookies allow us to provide a more enhanced service and help us to
learn what content our users like or don’t like, so we can make the
service even better. They also help us to provide you with personalised
content and teaching-related advertisements to help you with your
consideration of Initial Teacher Training and returning to teaching.
Whilst these cookies don’t collect your name or address, they do collect
a unique user identifier code, which is linked to your device.

The types of non-functional cookies we set are:

### Website usage

We measure website usage so that we can gain a better understanding of
how people use our site. This enables us to improve the information that
we provide. It also ensures that the service is available when you want
it, and that it delivers information quickly. We use Google Analytics to
gather this data.

### Marketing

We use cookies to make our marketing more engaging and relevant to
users. We use cookie information to focus our marketing on what’s
relevant to specific users, to improve performance reporting, and to
avoid showing ads that the user has already seen.

For example, we use cookies to remember your most recent searches, your
previous interactions with our ads or search results, and your visits to
our website.

We may also use data from conversion cookies to determine how many
people who click on our ads go on to sign up for services on our
website. Conversion cookies are not used by Google for interest-based ad
targeting and persist for a limited time only.

We place marketing tags on our pages to simply track the success of our
content per channel. Some of our pages may contain content from other
sites, like YouTube, which may set their own cookies. These sites are
sometimes called 'third party' services. This tells us how many people
are seeing the content and whether it's useful.

In addition, if you share a link to one of our pages, the service you
share it on (for example, Facebook) may set a cookie. We have no control
over cookies set on other websites - you can turn them off, but not
through us.
