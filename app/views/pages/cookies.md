## Marketing cookies

**Type:** Persistent cookies

**Administered by:** Third parties

**Purpose:** These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.

We place marketing tags on our pages to track the success of our content on each channel. Some of our pages may contain content from other sites, like YouTube, which may set their own Cookies. These sites are sometimes called â€˜third partyâ€™ services. This tells us how many people are seeing the content and whether itâ€™s useful. In addition, if you share a link to one of our pages, the service you share it on (for example, Facebook) may set a cookie. We have no control over cookies set on other websites - you can turn them off, but not through us.
