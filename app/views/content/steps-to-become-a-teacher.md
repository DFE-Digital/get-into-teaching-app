These steps can help you to achieve [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts), which you need to teach in many primary and secondary schools in England.

You do not have to follow all the steps in order, and some might take longer than others. If you need support, a [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers) can give you free practical advice and reassurance about all of these steps and more.
