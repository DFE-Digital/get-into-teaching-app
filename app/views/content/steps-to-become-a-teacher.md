<strong>Discover if a career teaching in a primary or secondary school in England is right for you.</strong>

<b>These steps can help you to achieve [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts), which you need to teach in many primary and secondary schools in England.</b>

<b>With QTS you also get additional training and support in your first 2 years as a teacher, helping you to grow in confidence and develop the skills you need to succeed.</b> 

<b>You do not have to follow all of the steps in order and some may take longer than others.</b>
