## Become a qualified teacher in England

Follow these steps if you want to become a qualified primary or secondary school teacher in England. You'll need to work towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). This can be achieved in different ways, including:

* doing a postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) course if you already have a degree
* doing an undergraduate degree course which leads to QTS

If you're not looking to teach primary or secondary, consider training to teach [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/further-education-teacher-training).

[What to do if you've already qualified to teach and want to come back to teaching.](/returning-to-teaching)
