Qualified teacher status (QTS) is what you need to teach in most primary and secondary schools in England.

It is a confirmation that you have the right training and meet the standards required to be a teacher.

QTS is a teaching standard that is respected across the world. Having QTS means you can move around the country and teach in any state school.

## How to get QTS

All postgraduate teacher training courses in England lead to QTS. You can see the different types of courses available by [searching for postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

Entry requirements for QTS courses include having an undergraduate degree and GCSEs at level 4/grade C or above in Maths and English. You’ll also need a level 4/grade C or above
in Science if you want to be a primary school teacher.

As well as offering QTS, many courses also offer a PGCE or PGDE. Find out about [PGCE and PGDE](/what-is-a-pgce).

## Assessment only route to QTS

It is possible to get QTS through an [assessment only programme](/assessment-only-providers) if you have the right teaching experience. You can usually do this if:

* you’ve already been employed as an unqualified teacher for a significant amount of time (for example, 2 years) and you’ve worked in more than one school
* [you’re a qualified teacher who trained overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk)
