Qualified teacher status (QTS) is what you need to teach in a state school in England. 

It is a confirmation that you have the right training and meet the standards required to be a teacher. 

All postgraduate teacher training courses in England lead to QTS. You can see the different types of courses available by [searching for postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

QTS is a teaching standard that is respected across the world. Having QTS means you can move around the country and teach in any state school.
