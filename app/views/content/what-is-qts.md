Qualified teacher status, ‘QTS’, is what you need to teach in a state school in England. 

It is not a course, but a confirmation that you have the right training and meet the standards required to be a teacher. 

Getting QTS usually comes after you have completed your initial teacher training.

As well as being a respected standard across the world, having QTS means you can move around the country and teach in any state school.

Some PGCE or PGDE courses can award you QTS with your course. You can check the qualifications a course offers by [searching for postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).
