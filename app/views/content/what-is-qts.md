Qualified teacher status, ‘QTS’, is what you need to teach in a state school in England. 

It is not a course, but a confirmation that you have the right training and meet the standards required to be a teacher. 

Some PGCE or PGDE courses can award you QTS. You can check the qualifications a course offers by [searching for postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

As well as being a respected standard across the world, having QTS means you can move around the country and teach in any state school.
