Find out what you need to include in your primary or secondary teacher training application and what happens as part of the application process. 

You can get help with your application from our [teacher training advisers](/teacher-training-advisers). They have years of teaching experience and can give you free, one-to-one support. 

## What course should I apply for? 

Make sure you check which qualification you’ll get through your training course. You'll train towards one of the following qualifications:

* [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts)
* QTS with a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-a-pgce)

While you do not need a PGCE to teach in England, you do need QTS to teach in many primary and secondary schools.

[Find a postgraduate teacher training course](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/).

## When should I apply for teacher training? 

You can start applying for courses from October, ready to start the following September (some courses may start at other points during the year).

It’s wise to apply as soon as you’re ready as:

* training providers allocate places as people apply, so some courses can get full quickly 

* providers may set conditions of offer, such as completing a [subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement) before you start your training 

* this will give you more time to plan how to fund your training

## What do I need to include in my teacher training application? 

You can apply to up to 4 courses at a time and will need to provide the following. 

### Your qualifications 

You’ll need to provide details about your: 

* GCSEs 
* A levels (and other qualifications) 
* degree 

Training providers will also accept some equivalent qualifications, for example, if you’re a non-UK citizen. 

[Find out more about the qualifications you need to teach](/train-to-be-a-teacher/qualifications-you-need-to-teach).

$check-your-qualifications$

### Your work experience 

You should enter all the jobs you’ve had since you left school. Make sure you explain any gaps longer than a month. 

If you do not have any work history (for example, if you’ve always been in full-time education, or you’ve been caring for a family member), you can mention that here. 

You can also talk about any unpaid experience you have and how this supports your application to become a teacher. 

### Your personal statement 

Your personal statement explains why you want to be a teacher. It’s a crucial part of your application so it’s worth taking your time on it. 

[Find out more about writing your teacher training personal statement](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-personal-statement). 

### Your adjustments 

You can ask for extra support if you’re disabled, have a mental health condition or educational needs. 

Your training provider can then make adjustments so you can attend an interview and do the training. 

[Find out what support you’re entitled to if you’re disabled](/funding-and-support/if-youre-disabled). 

### Your references 

You need to provide the details of 2 people who can give you a reference when you apply. They will not be contacted until you accept a place on a course. 

[Find out more about how to choose your references for teacher training](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-references).

## Start your application

You’ll need to [create an account](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/candidate/account) and then complete the different sections of your application form.

You do not have to complete the sections all at once – you can save and come back to them later.

## When will I find out if my application has been successful? 

Each training provider should review your application within 30 working days and decide whether to offer you a place on their course.

If a training provider does not respond within 30 working days, you can apply to another course while you wait for their response. You can also contact the training provider for more information about your application.

Holiday periods in England (such as Christmas and Easter) are not included in the 30 working days.

### If you’re invited to interview 

If your application is successful with a provider, you’ll be invited to an interview. 

Interviews vary from provider to provider – you’ll be given all the information you need when you’re invited to attend. 

[Find tips for your teacher training interview](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-interview). 

### Essential checks

If you get offered a place on a course, your provider will arrange a background and criminal records check. This is known as a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. You must pass these checks in order to teach students under 18.

### If you do not get a place 

Your teacher training provider should give you feedback if your application is unsuccessful. 

You may need to get an additional qualification, work on your interview technique or improve the quality of your application. 

You can apply to more courses if all your applications are unsuccessful.
