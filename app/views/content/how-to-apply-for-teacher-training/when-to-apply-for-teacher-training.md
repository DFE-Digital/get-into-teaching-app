Training providers should respond to your application within 30 days. If you do not receive a decision from your application after 30 days, you can submit an application for another course.

<li>courses are open for people to apply all year round</li>  
<li>you may need time to complete a <a href="/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement">subject knowledge enhancement (SKE)</a> course and other conditions before starting your training</li> 
<li>this will give you time to plan how you <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-support ">fund your training</a></li>
</ul>

“Applying late was stressful. I was limited in my choice of teacher training course provider, and I'd lost my GCSE certificates. I had to go back to my school and get new copies so I could confirm my place on the course and my student finance.”
