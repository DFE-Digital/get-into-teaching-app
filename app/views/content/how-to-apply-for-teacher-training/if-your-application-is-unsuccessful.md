Try not to worry - you can reapply if your application is unsuccessful. Many people are successful the second or third time around.

It’s worth looking at the feedback the course provider has given to understand why your application was not accepted. This will help you to decide on your next steps.

## Why was my application unsuccessful?

There could be a number of reasons your application was unsuccessful:


### The course is full

Unfortunately, popular courses do fill up quickly. You can [find another course](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) with a different provider if the one you applied for is now full.

### You do not have the GCSEs at minimum grade 4 (C), or equivalent

To train to teach in primary and secondary schools in England, you’ll need:

* GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary)

You could [find another course](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) with a training provider that will accept an equivalency test. You can also take your GCSE exams at any age if you do not have them or you can retake them to improve your grades. You can do this through a [GCSE training provider](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/find-a-course/search). Make sure when you visit the website, you search for GCSE courses.

### You do not have a bachelor’s degree or equivalent

You’ll need a bachelor's degree or equivalent to train to teach. If you do not have one, you can still train to teach by doing an [undergraduate degree in teacher training](/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-dont-have-a-degree) or become a [further education teacher](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/further-education-teachers).

### The provider could not verify your qualifications

To help show your qualifications, you can [get a certified statement of your exam results](https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate) if you did your GCSEs and A levels in the UK. You should also be able to request a copy of your degree certificate from the organisation where you studied in the UK.

### Lack of subject knowledge

You may be able to do a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course to top up your subject knowledge. You could also find a course in a different subject, which may also involve a SKE course to prepare you to teach that subject. [Find out if you're eligible for a SKE course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement).

### Lack of teaching or safeguarding knowledge

It may help to [get some school experience](/train-to-be-a-teacher/get-school-experience) so you can find out what it’s like to be a teacher and improve your knowledge and skills.

### No visa sponsorship

Find out more about [how visa sponsorships work](/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student) if you want to train to teach in the UK. You may also find another training provider that will sponsor a visa by searching for courses and then filtering by ‘Only show courses with visa sponsorship’.
