A teacher training personal statement is a professional document that you’ll submit as part of your postgraduate teacher training application.

Your personal statement is your chance to make yourself memorable with teacher training providers.

You can use it to show:

* why you want to teach  

* why you’ll make a great teacher  

## How to write your teacher training personal statement

Teacher training personal statements can be up to 1000 words. 90% of successful candidates write 500 words or more. It can take time to write a good personal statement, but you do not have to write it in one go.

Your personal statement is your chance to make a good first impression with providers. Checking your spelling and grammar will show your attention to detail and that you care about your application.

### What to include in your personal statement

You can include any information you think is relevant to demonstrate your knowledge and experience.

As well as showing your passion for teaching, your statement should include:

* evidence of research and understanding of the role of a teacher and the national curriculum

* relevant experience, especially if you've worked with young people before

* transferable skills and how you can bring these skills into the classroom

* why you want to teach your chosen subject and examples of how you’ll do this

### Using AI to help write a personal statement

You should not rely on ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence (AI) tools to write your personal statement. AI tools use bland language and produce generic results which will not make your statement personal to you.

AI tools are useful for structuring a personal statement or for giving you ideas for what to include. But being overly reliant on AI tools to write your personal statement may result in your application being unsuccessful.

Your account to apply for teacher training may be blocked if you consistently submit personal statements that look like they have been written solely by AI tools.

### Tailoring your personal statement

You can use the same personal statement for every course you apply for. There may be some instances where you’d like to tailor it to different courses.

You can use your personal statement to explain why you feel passionate about teaching a specific age range or subject. You might also want to include why you want to do your teaching training with a particular provider.

If you’re applying for a primary course with a subject specialism, or you’re particularly interested in certain primary subjects, you can include that in your statement.
