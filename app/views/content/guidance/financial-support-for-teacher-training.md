The level of financial support you get will depend on the subject you
choose and the way you train to become a teacher.

There are several types of funding that may all be available to you,
depending on your eligibility:

  - a bursary or scholarship
  - tuition fee and maintenance loans
  - extra financial support if you're a parent, a carer, or you have a
    disability

Please note that alternative funding is in place to train as an Early
Years teacher, which leads to achieving Early Years Teacher Status
(EYTS).

## Bursaries

A bursary is a tax-free sum of money awarded to high quality graduates
who meet eligibility criteria and train to teach in certain subjects.
You may be eligible for a bursary or a scholarship but you cannot
receive both. If you receive one, you will not have to pay it back.

They are only available in the following subjects:

  - chemistry, computing, maths, physics - £24,000
  - classics, languages - £10,000
  - biology - £7,000

### Eligibility

Bursaries are awarded to candidates:

  - with a 2:2 or above in their undergraduate degree, a Masters or a
    PhD

  - taking a qualifying postgraduate or undergraduate ITT course in
    England
  - who comply with the terms and conditions of the bursary scheme
  - not in possession of, or eligible for QTS
  - not undertaking paid teaching work when in receipt of the bursary
  - not simultaneously undertaking any other ITT course, training scheme
    or programme that leads to QTS

### How you will be paid

You don’t need to apply for a bursary. If you’re enrolled on a
non-salaried postgraduate course and meet the eligibility criteria, you
will begin receiving payments from your chosen teacher training provider
when you begin your course.

How you’re paid will depend on the amount of financial support you
receive. If you’re awarded a bursary, you’ll receive this in 10 equal
monthly instalments from October to July.

You are advised to confirm payment schedules with your training
provider.
