You may be eligible for financial support if you meet the requirements
explained on this page. This is an overview of the rules, and exceptions
may apply in certain circumstances. For help and advice, review the
information at the GOV.UK pages listed at [more information](#more-information)
or contact [Student Finance England](https://www.gov.uk/contact-student-finance-england).

## Applicants from countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland

If you are an applicant from outside [the EEA](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) or
Switzerland, you are unlikely to be eligible for financial support.

In order to be eligible for student support, you must usually have
'settled' status and have been living in the UK throughout the three
years immediately before the start of your course.

For more information, contact [Student Finance England](https://www.gov.uk/contact-student-finance-england).

## Applicants from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland

The EEA includes EU countries, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

If you have [settled or pre-settled status](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/what-settled-and-presettled-status-means)
under the EU Settlement Scheme, you may be able to get some or all of
the following types of financial help with your living costs or teacher
training course fees ('tuition fees').

Special provisions apply to [Irish citizens](#irish-citizens).

Types of financial help:

### Tuition fee loan

Your tuition fees are paid, with the money going directly to your teacher
training provider. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you'll only start
your repayments when your income is over £27,295 per year.

### Maintenance loan

Money is paid directly into your bank account to help with living costs. This
is a loan you have to pay back, but you'll only start your repayments when your
income is over £27,295 per year.

### Home fee status

You are charged tuition fees at the domestic rate, which is usually lower than
the rate charged to international students.

### Extra financial support

You can apply for extra help if you have a disability, or children or other
people to care for. You do not have to pay this money back.

### Teacher training bursary or scholarship

Money is paid directly into your bank account and you can use this as you wish.
You do not have to pay this money back.

### Check what support is available

#### Tuition fee and maintenance loans

You will generally be eligible for both a tuition fee loan and a
maintenance loan if you:

* have settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families),
  and
* have been resident in the UK throughout the 3 years before the
  start of your course

Alternatively, you may be able to get both a tuition fee loan and a
maintenance loan if you:

* have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme,
  and
* have been resident in the UK, EEA or Switzerland throughout the 3
  years before the start of your course, and
* are an EEA/Swiss worker or a family member of one

A '[worker](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/information--advice/fees-and-money/government-student-support#layer-6212)'
is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK.

A '[family member](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/information--advice/fees-and-money/government-student-support#layer-6212)'
is a spouse or civil partner, child and, sometimes, parent or grandparent.

#### Tuition fee loan without maintenance loan

If you are not eligible for both a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan
then you may be able to get a tuition fee loan without a maintenance
loan if you:

* are an EU national with settled or pre-settled status under the EU
  Settlement Scheme, and
* have been resident in the UK, EEA or Switzerland throughout the 3
  years before the start of your course

More detailed guidance is available for [EEA and Swiss students about
eligibility for tuition fee and maintenance loans in the academic year 2021 to
2022](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-uk-guidance-for-eu-students#changes-to-funding-from-the-2021-to-2022-academic-year).

### Irish citizens

Special provisions apply to Irish citizens. If you are an Irish citizen
then you do not need to have settled or pre-settled status under the EU
Settlement Scheme as you already have settled status in the UK.

You will generally be eligible for a [tuition fee loan](#tuition-fee-loan) and a
[maintenance loan](#maintenance-loan) if you:

  - are an Irish citizen, and
  - have been resident in the UK throughout the 3 years immediately before the
    start of your course

You will generally be eligible for a [tuition fee loan](#tuition-fee-loan) only if you:

  - are an Irish citizen, and
  - have been resident in Ireland, or Ireland and the UK, throughout
    the 3 years before the start of your course

### Home fee status

If you meet the requirements for a tuition fee loan, or tuition fee and
maintenance loan, we anticipate that providers will award you home fee
status.

### Extra financial support for trainees with particular needs

If you have a disability, children or adult dependents, and you are
eligible for a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan, you may be able to
apply for extra help. [Learn more about extra financial support](/funding-your-training).

### Teacher training bursary or scholarship

If you meet the eligibility requirements for a tuition fee loan, or
tuition fee and maintenance loan, you may also be eligible for a teacher
training bursary or scholarship.

[Bursaries and scholarships are only available in certain subjects](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships).

## How to apply

You can apply for financial support when you've accepted your place on
an unsalaried teacher training course.

Apply to [Student Finance England](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance) for:

  - tuition fee loans
  - maintenance loans
  - extra help if you have a disability, children or adult dependents

Talk to your training provider about:

  - home fee status (they are likely to offer this if you've been awarded a tuition fee loan)
