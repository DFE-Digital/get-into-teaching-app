Teaching is a challenging but rewarding career that allows you to make a significant impact on pupils' lives. With no two days being the same, it’s an excellent choice for those who thrive in a dynamic and varied work environment.

## A day in the life of a teacher

### Morning

#### 7:30am arrive at school

Teachers often start their day early, arriving at school somwhere between 7:00am to 8:00am. The morning is usually spent preparing resources for the day ahead so that everything is organised for when the pupils arrive.


#### 8:45am pupils arrive

Depending on your role, you might be responsible for a form group or registering students. During this time, pupils typically engage in morning activities. It's also an opportunity to talk to students individually to check their wellbeing.


#### 9:15am morning lessons 
The structure of the school day will depend on your school, but often there are 2 lessons taught in the morning followed by a break. In total, there may be 5 hour-long lessons in the day. Each class could be around 30 pupils and will have its own dynamics as well as unique needs.

#### 11:15am morning break
Teachers are sometimes responsible for break-time duties. This involves supervising pupils for their safety but it is an opportunity to interact with pupils outside of the classroom and build relationships. 

#### 11:35am lessons 

After break, pupils return to lessons with renewed energy, which can be harnessed and channeled into their work. During this time, teachers usually teach two more lessons before lunch.

### Lunch

Lunch is an opportunity for teachers to have a well-earned break and go to the staff room to talk about how the morning has been. Many teachers also use this as an opportunity to get ahead on their marking. By tackling some books during this time, it can reduce the amount of marking needed to be done in the afternoon.

### Afternoon

#### 2:15pm afternoon lessons 

After lunch, there is often just one more lesson to teach. Schools sometimes work the timetable this way because after lunch pupils are generally more excitable making it harder to teach.  


#### 3:15pm pupils leave school
When pupils leave school the work continues. Teachers generally spend this time marking work and planning upcoming lessons.

Some teachers will also run an afterschool club such as a football team, drama sessions or computer club.

#### 5:00pm leave school

Depending on how the teacher likes to split their work, they will leave school between 4:30pm to 6:00pm. Some teachers will take home books to mark or carry on planning once they are at home.

### Planning preparation and assessment time (PPA)
Teachers are entitled 10% of their time off time table to plan work. Depending on the school, this could mean that you have a couple of lessons free next to each other or they could be spread across the week.

## Challenges of teaching

### Managing behaviour
Teaching is not just about delevering content. It also involves helping pupils understand how to behave appropriately in school. Pupils will test limits, become disruptive, or fail to follow instructions at times, which can be daunting. 

However, training courses will  provide you with strategies to boost your confidence and make you feel prepared. Schools will also have behavior policies in place which you can follow and colleagues will help support you.

### Workload
Teaching around 5 lessons a day to classes of 30 children can create a lot of admin. Some teachers use all their time in school to get this work done and others take work home. Over time with more experience you will get quicker at planning and marking and will be able to reuse resources you have created to reduce your workload.

## Positives of being a teacher 

### Having a fulfilling career 
 Life as a teacher is more than just a job. The relationships you build with children and the knowledge you share will shape pupils lives. The joy of witnessing a pupils's growth and knowing you played a part in their journey makes teaching a deeply fulfilling and meaningful profession.

### Holidays
As a teacher, you will work for 195 days a year. That means that you will have more holiday than many other people in different proffessions. The longer holidays especially in the summer allow more flexibility to travel further afeild. 

### A supportive workplace 

Since teachers often face similar challenges and work towards the common goal of pupils success and wellbeing, they naturally support and uplift one another. Whether it’s sharing lesson plans, offering classroom management tips, or simply providing a listening ear, teachers work together to overcome obstacles and improve their practices.
