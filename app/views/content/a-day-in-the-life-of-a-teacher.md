In the course of a normal day, most teachers would deliver lessons to over 100 students with different interests and learning needs."

Life as a teacher is a rewarding career. Filled with real purpose you can make a real difference to pupils' lives. However, the career brings its own challeneges too which we will explore to help you make the right choice for your career.

## A day in the life of a teacher

#### 7:30am Arrive at school

Teachers often start their day early, typically arriving at school somwhere between 7:00am to 8:00am. The morning is usually spent preparing resources for the day ahead so that everything is organised for when the pupils arrive.

Sometimes in the morning, there will also be a staff meeting to ensure that everyone is up to date with school messages, important announcements, and any changes to the day's schedule.

#### 8:45am pupils arrive

At around 9:00am pupils will start school. Depending on your role, you may be in charge of a form group or registering children. In this time pupils usually get on with morning activities, such as spelling or maths activities. It is also a chance to catch up with pupils individually and ensure their wellbeing and create a shared sense of identity as a group.


#### 9:15am morning lessons 
The structure of the school day will depend on the school but often there are 2 lessons taught in the morning followed by a break. In total there are often 5 hour lessons in the day. Depending on your school you could teach around 30 pupils of mixed abilities.

#### 11:15am morning break
Teachers are sometimes responsible for break-time duties. This involves supervising pupils during to make sure that they are safe and that an adult is avaialable if anything happens. Teachers might patrol the playground and monitor indoor areas to adress any issues that arise. This also gives teachers an opportunity to interact with pupils outside of the classrom and building a postive rapport. 

Teachers who do not have a break-duty spend their time in the staff room talking or in their classrooms catching up with any marking to reduce the amount they have to do later on.

#### 11:35am lessons 

After break pupils must settle down again and usually do two more sets of lessons before lunch.

#### 1:35pm lunch

Lunch is an opportunity for teachers to have break. Teachers will often go to a staff room with other teachers, have their lunch and have a well earned chat about what they have done in the morning. Many teachers also use this as an opportunity to get ahead on their marking. By tackling some books during this time it can reduce the amount of marking needed to be done in the afternoon.

#### 2:15pm afternoon lessons 

Often there is one more lesson of the day before pupils are done for the day. 

#### 3:15pm End of the day 
When pupils leave school the work continues for teachers. They will generally spend this time marking any work and planning future lessons. 

Once a week after school there is often a school meeting. In this meeting teachers get to together to do training or talk about things such as data. 

Teachers may also run an after school club. Some teachers may run an activity such as a football team, drama club or computer games. Running these clubs can be extra effort but it is also rewarding to share a passion in a more infomral setting and build stronger relations with your pupils. 



Some teachers will run an afterschool club such as a football team, drama club or computer games. 

Depending on how the teacher likes to split their work they will leave school between 4.30 to 6. Some teachers will also take home books to mark or carry on planning once they are at home.

## Planning preparation and assessment time (PPA)
Teachers are entitled to planning preparation and assessment time (PPA), this is at least 10% of teachers timetabled time. Depending on the time table of the school this could mean that you have a couple of lessons free next to each other or they could be spread across the week. During this time teachers usually plan upcoming lessons and streams of work.Or they use it to mark and assess work.
