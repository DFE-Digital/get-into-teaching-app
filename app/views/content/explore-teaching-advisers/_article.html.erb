    <p>
      Finding out which career is right for you is not always easy. How do you know what something is like if you've never done it before?

    <p>
      Our explore teaching advisers help you discover whether the classroom is where you belong. You can get support and guidance from a dedicated adviser who can answer all your questions about what teaching is really like.
    </p>

    <p>
      All our advisers are experienced former teachers who can help you gain an insight into the world of teaching. You can talk to them as little or as much as you'd like.

    <h2 class="heading-s">How to get an explore teaching adviser</h2>

    <p>
        To be eligible for an explore teaching adviser, you just need:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        to be studying for an undergraduate degree, not in your final year of study
      </li>
      <li>
        an interest in teaching
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If you're a veteran, you can get an adviser with or without a degree.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're in your final year of study or you already have a degree, you can still get a teacher training adviser.
