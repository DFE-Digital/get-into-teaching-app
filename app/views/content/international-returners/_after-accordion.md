### What can you expect from the Department for Education?

#### Continuous professional development (CPD) and competitive teaching salaries

DfE can support your CPD through [National Professional Qualifications (NPQs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-list-of-providers)
for middle and senior leadership, headship and executive leadership.
[We'll be introducing improved NPQs from September 2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-frameworks-from-september-2021).

In July 2020, [competitive new salary increases](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/teachers-set-for-biggest-pay-rise-in-fifteen-years) for teachers were agreed.

#### Supporting our critical workers in education

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vital role of teachers, who continue
to show extraordinary dedication and commitment. We at DfE are profoundly
grateful for the hard work of everyone in the profession.

[Read our COVID-19 guidance for school and teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19).

We’re taking action to address some of the common issues that teachers face in the classroom and have collaborated with schools to:

* [develop a workload reduction kit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [invest £10m in Behaviour hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs)
  so schools with exemplary pupil behaviour can help other schools improve
* increase [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools)
  for teachers

Teacher mental health is an important focus for DfE. Read our [Teaching blog](https://teaching.blog.gov.uk/) to
