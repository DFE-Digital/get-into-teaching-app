If you completed your initial teacher training in England, you should already
have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).
You can check your QTS in [Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT)](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login).

If you have been working as an unqualified teacher overseas, youâ€™ll need QTS to teach in a maintained school in England.

Even where QTS is not a legal requirement, for example in academies and free
schools, many schools use it to assess the quality of candidates for teaching
jobs.

If you trained as a teacher outside the UK, depending on where you qualified, you may be able to [apply to the Teaching Regulation Agency for QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#apply-to-the-teaching-regulation-agency-tra).

If you have experience working as a teacher, and a degree, you may be able to
get QTS through the [assessment only (AO) route](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#AO) without any further training or the need to visit the UK.
[View training providers who offer AO to overseas candidates](/assessment-only-providers#group--international).

If you have fewer than 2 years' teaching experience, you will need to [apply
for a teacher training course in England](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)
leading to QTS.
