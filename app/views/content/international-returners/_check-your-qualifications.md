If you completed your initial teacher training in England, you should already
have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).
You can check your [QTS on the Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT)](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login?_ga=2.83830559.800854691.1615204427-200282563.1595352460).

If you have been working as an unqualified teacher overseas, you should be
aware that you’ll need QTS to teach in a maintained school in England.

Even where QTS is not a legal requirement, for example in academies and free
schools, many schools use it to assess the quality of candidates for teaching
jobs.

You will therefore strengthen your application for teaching jobs in England in
all school types if you have QTS.

If you have experience working as a teacher, and a degree, you may be able to
get QTS through the Assessment only (AO) route without any further training.
Some [training providers](/assessment-only-providers)
do AO overseas. You can check with providers directly to see if they provide
overseas AO.

If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you will need to apply
for a [teacher training course](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/)
leading to QTS. You may also be able to apply for [fast-track QTS if you’ve
trained as a teacher in certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#teachers-from-the-eu-iceland-liechtenstein-norway-switzerland-australia-canada-new-zealand-or-usa).
