75% of schools in England now advertise their teaching  jobs on DfE’s free
[Teaching Vacancies service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up a job alert to search by:

* working pattern (full or part-time)
* location
* subject
* role
* educational phase (primary, middle, secondary, 16 to 19)

Schools and heads in England recognise the value of your overseas experience.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they are also increasingly familiar and
comfortable with remote recruitment and assessment.
