  An interview with Gary Hellyer
date: "2021-05-05"
---

Gary Hellyer, 31, trained in England as a primary school teacher and
then moved to Oman to work at the British School Muscat. He moved to
London after 3 years abroad and now works in an independent school.

### How did you start your career in teaching?

At school, I was on the [Aim Higher](https://aimhigherlondon.org.uk/) programme
because no one in my family had been in higher education. I didn't think I'd
get to university as I struggled in my A levels.

Having completed my teacher training, I was offered a job at my first
placement school, St Edwards, a Church of England school in Plymouth. I
completed my newly qualified teacher (NQT) year teaching Year 6.

### What prompted your move to Oman?

Year 6 in the UK is such a heavy year. It can take its toll on you. I
recall myself and a close friend who studied sports development and
coaching were having such different experiences.

My friend had got a job overseas teaching PE. When I did my PGCE, my
specialism had been PE, so I thought I'd look to find something
similar.When a job at the British School Muscat came up, the work-life
balance and testimonials on the website convinced me it was worth a try.
I thought, worst-case scenario, I can come back in a year.

> Early years is amazing. Never underestimate 4 and 5-year-olds!

I spent the next 3 years in Oman. I taught Year 3 for 2 years and then
we had a Council of British International Schools (COBIS) inspection
which singled out our Early Years (EY) education as an exemplary feature
of the school. I decided I wanted to go into that phase, especially as I
was already aware that very few men teach it.

### How did teaching in Oman compare to teaching here?

In Oman people are very positive – after all, we're in this fantastic
place, with the perks of a warm climate and a good work-life balance.
The school where I worked was a British school with a British curriculum
and British values.

Teachers from the UK were buddied up before we went and sent welcome
packs with what to expect. We arrived at the school a week before
everyone else in mid-August and were put through an induction. There
were 19 of us, forming a tight-knit group. At the school itself, a few
of the teachers came from Australia and America, but around 70% of the
staff were British.

While in Oman I put myself forward for the COBIS middle leaders course,
which I’m not sure I would have had the opportunity to do in England. My
project focused on using technology to enhance learning.

The principal was fantastic, asked what I was enjoying and what I would
change. A growth mindset is really important. We were more aware of how
every child learns differently.

### Why did you decide to come back to England?

They tried to convince me to stay which made me feel like I had a
positive impact on the school and the children. However, I had always
planned to move back to England to live with my partner, who is a
teacher in Hackney, after 3 years.

Teaching abroad is amazing – there are so many positives. It can seem
daunting going back to the UK, but for me there are three big
advantages: access to training, the support of your union, and staying
up to date with the UK curriculum.

You also get more job security in the English education system.

### What practical hurdles did you have to overcome?

Making the move back wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. It
felt like a smooth transition because the British School Muscat is so
good at maintaining ties with the UK.

For example, we’d experienced the same changes in the curriculum as in
England and had followed the same framework, which was an advantage for
me in interviews.

My school in Oman were also very helpful; they provided fantastic
references and supported my decision to go home. I was lucky because
they said if you can't get a job in England, we’ll keep you.

The main barrier for me was financial. The flight back was £450, so I
could only afford to do it once. On top of that, my school gave me time
off for one interview and you know you may be limited on how much time
you can have off.

Communication is quite hard when you're abroad, so having the
opportunity to do interviews remotely would be an advantage. In that
sense, a positive to come from this pandemic is that schools have been
forced to adapt.

### What has been the response to your international experience from schools and heads in England?

Because I've gone through different year groups, I’ve always aimed to
finish each year a more accomplished teacher than I started. A lot of
schools think it's fantastic that I have an overview of where children
start school and where they need to be when they leave primary school.

The school I originally worked in when I returned from Oman, could have
paid me as a second year teacher; instead, they chose to acknowledge my
experience abroad and what that can bring. Schools need to value that
creativity and what you’re bringing back from around the world.

After my interview, I was told, ‘you're a maverick and you're going to
have different approaches to things’. My interviewer was open-minded and
saw everything I'd done as a positive.

### What would be your top tips for making the move back?

1. My first port of call would be [TES](https://www.tes.com/). Set that job
   alert up, get those emails coming through! I put in as many applications as
   I could, even if it meant joining one school and moving after. It was all
   about getting back to the UK.

   You can also browse jobs and set up alerts using [DfE's Teaching vacancies
   service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/), which is used by 75% of
   schools in England.

2. Sell yourself. Everyone has positives and it is important to show schools
   what you have to offer and what makes you stand out. Everyone has a unique
   selling point.

3. Be proactive. Chase up on applications and ensure you are always looking and
   aware of current jobs. Don’t expect jobs to come to you.  Send CVs to
   schools you like the look of. It can be a positive when schools see that you
   hold them in high regard and aren’t just contacting them because they have a
   job.

4. Ensure your application is tailored to the school. Use your experiences and
   link them to the school. For example, Oman is culturally diverse, and the
   same applies to London.

### What's been the best bit about coming back to teaching in the UK?

I have returned with broader life experience and I have something to
offer schools in the UK. I feel there are more opportunities in schools
here to continue my development and progress as an individual.

When I first came back to London I worked at Sebright Primary School in
EY in reception, but I was then moved to Y1. I realised I wanted to stay
in EY, so I moved schools and now work in the independent sector, at
Forest School in Walthamstow.
