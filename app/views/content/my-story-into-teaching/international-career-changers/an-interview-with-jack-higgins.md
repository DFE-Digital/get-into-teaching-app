  An interview with Jack Higgins
date: "2021-05-05"
---

Jack Higgins, 24, spent 2 years teaching English as a foreign language
in Spain before coming back to England to train as a teacher. He is now
studying for his PGCE + QTS in modern foreign languages at the
University of York.

### What prompted your decision to work in Spain?

I realised that I wanted to pursue a career in something that involved
languages while studying for my A levels in Philosophy, History and
Spanish.

After four years of university study reading Italian and Spanish at the
University of Manchester, including a year spent in Spain and Italy, I
graduated with first class honours.

After this, I decided to return to Madrid for a couple of years to teach
English as a foreign language and perfect my Spanish. I thoroughly
enjoyed my teaching experience in Spain and it made me realise that as
well as having a passion for languages, I also had a passion for
teaching.

### Why did you decide to train as a teacher in England?

Teaching in Spain made me realise how much I enjoy teaching in general.
However, I also learnt that I didn’t just want to teach English to
Spanish students. Coming back to England to train made a lot of sense to
me. It provided me with the opportunity not only to develop my career as
a teacher, but also to share my passion for foreign languages with young
people in the UK and inspire them to take the route that I did.

I have a lot of friends who completed a PGCE straight after graduating
from their undergraduate degree. When I asked them about how they found
their course and the teaching profession in general, I got very positive
responses and this inspired me to apply for a PGCE myself.

I applied to three universities and, thankfully, my first choice
university offered me a place.

### Did you have to do anything else to prepare for teacher training?

I completed a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course in French. I kept up
to date with the news regarding education, which has helped me understand my
role as a teacher in the wider system of education in England. I also
familiarised myself with the
[national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum)
and the [Teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)
so that I knew what was expected of me as a teacher.

### How are you finding teacher training so far?

Despite the heavy workload and the situation regarding Covid-19, I am
thoroughly enjoying the course. I am being trained to become a
reflective practitioner and taught to always question what I am
presented with. I believe this is essential in order to continuously
improve the education system and I am grateful to be part of that
process.

Surprisingly, the main thing that I am enjoying about my teacher
training is the fact that I am completing it in the midst of a global
pandemic! Although this is really challenging, teaching, like
everything, is rapidly changing due to Covid-19. It’s really interesting
to see how we’re developing effective teaching strategies in such
testing times.

### What advice would you give to someone who is planning to return to England to train to teach? 

The first thing that I would advise is to not panic! Although the
prospect of completing a year of teacher training may seem daunting, it
is also one of the most enjoyable experiences you will ever have and one
in which you will meet the most amazing, supportive people.

Take one step at a time and break your year up into smaller sections – I
found this makes it all feel more manageable. Teaching really is one of
the most rewarding jobs there are, so you won’t be disappointed by your
decision to enter this incredible profession.
