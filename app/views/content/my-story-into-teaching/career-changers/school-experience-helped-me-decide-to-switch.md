  Zainab Kasmani's route into teaching

    text: I started thinking about the other options. I thought about speech and language therapy and teaching children with special needs. I thought, 'The only way I'm going to know for certain if teaching is the right career for me, is if I go part-time at work and volunteer in a school'.

I graduated with a degree in English language and communication, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to travel. I completed a starter course and went to teach English abroad.

When I returned I worked in the NHS for 4 years, but the job was not for me.

I volunteered at a local primary school for two days a week and from the moment I walked into my first class, it felt very natural to be interacting with children.

In my previous role I learnt a lot about diversity issues. I had dealt with situations where language had been a barrier to people accessing services. This experience has really helped me to support pupils from a wide range of backgrounds in their learning and development.

Teaching is a lot more vibrant than my previous career. Schools offer a very dynamic working environment. You encounter problems, as you would in any career but you have the support of colleagues to try new approaches and techniques until you find the right solution. This really helps you develop as a teacher.
