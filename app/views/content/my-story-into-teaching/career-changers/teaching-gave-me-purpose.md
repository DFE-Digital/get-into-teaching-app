With a Masters in applied translation studies, I set out on a career with a language services company. I've always enjoyed sharing my knowledge of languages, so teaching was a natural step. Using my language skills was a key to my role, but it didn't provide opportunities for interaction.

I opted for a school-led route into teaching to get qualified, which allowed me to be based in a school from the very start of training. It gave me more time to put the theory I learnt at a university into practice.

This style of training is very much a hands-on approach to learning to teach, with the focus on the practicalities in the classroom. It also helps pupils to accept you as a member of staff from the beginning instead of an outsider part-way through term.

I was also supported by a university, which I attended once a week, where we learnt the pedagogy to support classroom experiences. Interacting with lots of different people – both children and adults – and the varied work from beginners to advanced level.

I got valuable school experience which meant I could observe lessons in a school and talk to teachers. I really recommend doing this as it will help you know if you would actually be able to cope with a group of children!
