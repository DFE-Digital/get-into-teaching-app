I joined the Royal Marine Commandos after university – I wanted to be on the Royal Navy's amphibious force. After 4 years of Service, I decided teaching was the profession I had always wanted to join. Gaining essential life experience was invaluable; not only did I achieve a better understanding of the world, but it has also equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to provide guidance and advice to teenagers.

I am coming towards the end of my teacher training (geography) course, and I'm looking forward to being in the classroom full-time. An outstanding teacher will always exceed expectations by passionately delivering interesting and exciting lessons.

The unique expertise acquired from my military background offered a range of specialist interests that has aided the development of pupils I trained with. Teaching has also given me the opportunity to positively contribute to the people-centred culture of the school, as well as the key values of mutual respect and enabling pupils to realise their potential personally and socially, not just academically.

Our experience has taught us determination, adaptability, fortitude, courage and leadership skills. These qualities are ingrained in us and will allow us to become effective teachers and mentors.
