International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a new teaching qualification backed by England’s [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) (DfE). 

QTS is now open to applications from candidates outside the UK who wish to train to internationally recognised English teaching standards. 

For entry in September 2022, iQTS will be available from a limited number of teacher training providers. From September 2023, iQTS will roll out to further training providers. 

Candidates who successfully apply for iQTS will:

* complete their studies without the need to visit the UK
* be taught and assessed by experienced, UK government-approved English teacher training providers
* benefit from the same excellent evidence-based approach to teacher training and rigorous quality control as teachers trained in England
* receive regular feedback and mentoring on their teaching practice 
* gain a teaching status equivalent to QTS, the English gold standard for teachers
* gain a prestigious qualification valued by British international schools and many other schools and institutions around the world

## What you’ll need to apply for iQTS

To apply for iQTS you will need to have: 

* a first degree from a UK or non-UK university
* achieved a standard equivalent to grade 4 in GCSE mathematics
for teaching children aged 3 to 11 (English primary school), a standard equivalent to grade 4 in a GCSE science (biology, chemistry or physics) subject
* demonstrated proficiency in the English language (you’ll need an [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/) score of 6.5 or higher, the equivalent score in another English language testing system, or to have completed some of your education in English, for example, a degree studied in English)

For help understanding English university degree and GCSE qualifications, and their international equivalents, visit [UK ENIC](https://www.ecctis.com/Default.aspx), the UK National Information Centre for global qualifications and skills.

Your iQTS training provider can give you more information about their application process.

The iQTS qualification is suitable for:

* UK citizens currently working abroad who wish to start teacher training or develop their teaching career
* Non-UK citizens who wish to begin teacher training or build on existing teaching experience
* UK and non-UK teachers without QTS who wish to improve their employability internationally and in England with a UK government-backed and approved professional qualification

## Location and delivery

Candidates complete the iQTS training programme without visiting the UK. Your training will consist of a year of full-time study including:

* tuition from your English teacher training provider, delivered using remote working technology
* face-to-face mentoring at your placement school (your training provider will help you find a suitable placement, if necessary)
* regular feedback and rigorous assessment

## Qualifying to work as a teacher in England

Successful graduates of the iQTS programme will be able to apply to England’s Teaching Regulation Agency for [qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) (QTS) without doing any further training. They will then have the correct qualification to teach in all schools in England. iQTS graduates who wish to apply for QTS will be able to apply online to the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA), alongside other teachers who are already eligible for QTS on the basis of having an overseas qualification. 

If an iQTS trainee applies for QTS, they will need to complete the Early career framework (ECF) induction in order to become a fully qualified teacher in England. They will be able to complete their ECF induction either in an accredited British School Overseas (BSO), or in a state-funded school in England. During the ECF, they will be assessed against [English Teachers' standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards).

This guidance relates to teaching in England. Different rules apply to teaching in [Wales](https://www.ewc.wales/site/index.php/en/registration/practitioners-trained-outside-wales.html), [Scotland](https://www.ewc.wales/site/index.php/en/registration/practitioners-trained-outside-wales.html) and [Northern Ireland](https://gtcni.org.uk/registration/getting-registered).


## Fees

Fees for iQTS will be decided by individual training providers. 

## Dates

iQTS application opens in September 2021 for study commencing September 2022. Places will initially be limited, with more becoming available year on year starting September 2023.
