## Introducing iQTS

International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a new teaching qualification backed by England’s Department for Education (DfE). iQTS is equivalent to qualified teacher status (QTS). You can train where you live and work.

2. Train for a year via remote learning and at a school in your region 
3. Fees for iQTS vary – check with participating iQTS training providers

## Six reasons to apply for iQTS

1. iQTS leads to the award of English qualified teacher status ([QTS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts)) with no further fees or training, and qualifies you to teach in all schools in England


2. iQTS is open to international candidates from anywhere in the world who meet the eligibility criteria


3. iQTS training and assessment are completed in your home country or school workplace, with no need to visit the UK

5. iQTS is equivalent to and meets the same teaching standards as QTS – regarded as the teacher training gold standard by British international schools and other schools and employers around the world


6. Unlike an iPGCE, iQTS is a UK-government backed professional qualification which qualifies you to teach in all schools in England

## Who is iQTS for?

iQTS is a teaching qualification designed for UK and non-UK citizens living outside the UK. If you are a UK or non-UK citizen living in England, you should [apply for teacher training in England](/steps-to-become-a-teacher). 

iQTS is for you if:
 
* you have no previous teaching qualifications or experience, and would like to gain a professional teaching qualification equivalent to QTS

* you have some experience teaching, and would benefit from training and mentoring leading to a professional teaching qualification equivalent to QTS

* you wish to teach in England, and you have a qualification (for example, a PGCE, PGDE or iPGCE) that does not allow you to teach in all schools in England

* you are already a teacher, and you wish to develop professionally and enhance your global employability with an internationally recognised teaching qualification

* you are already a teacher, and would benefit from a professional teaching qualification allowing you to teach in all schools in England

## Apply for iQTS, step by step

### 1. Check your eligibility

To apply for iQTS you will need to have: 

* a bachelor’s degree from a UK or non-UK university

* a maths qualification equivalent to an English GCSE grade 4 

* for teaching children aged 3 to 11, a biology, chemistry or physics qualification equivalent to an English GCSE grade 4 

* excellent written and verbal English language skills

#### Help with qualifications
A GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16. 

If you’re not sure of the status of your degree in England, or whether your qualifications in maths, biology, chemistry or physics are equivalent to an English GCSE grade 4, visit [UK ENIC](https://www.ecctis.com/Default.aspx), the UK National Information Centre for global qualifications and skills.

To show you meet the required standard in the English language, you’ll need one of the following:

* an [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/) score of 6.5 or higher

* the equivalent score in another English language testing system

* to have completed some of your education in English, for example, a degree studied in English
 
### 2. Find out about fees

Fees for iQTS vary between individual training providers – check with participating iQTS training providers.

If you are already employed in a school, you’ll have the opportunity to discuss with your training provider whether you can continue working in that school while you complete your iQTS studies.  

You may in some circumstances be paid a salary for your work in a placement school – this will vary between schools and between providers.
