## Next steps: qualifying to work as a teacher in England

Successful graduates of the iQTS programme will be able to apply to England’s Teaching Regulation Agency for [qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) (QTS) without doing any further training. They will then have the correct qualification to teach in all schools in England. 

## Early career teacher (ECT) induction

Having qualified teacher status (QTS) allows you to apply for paid teaching jobs in England, but many schools will also require you to complete an Early career teacher (ECT) 2-year induction period.

During this time you’ll work and be assessed as a paid teacher in an English school. This induction period is part of the UK government’s [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework) for teachers. You’ll be expected to show you meet the [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) and you’ll also get training and support from a mentor.

You can also complete your ECT induction outside the UK. However the school where you complete your induction must have met requirements set by DfE in England. Check a list of schools which have met these requirements.

## Qualifying to teach in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland

This guidance relates to teaching in England. Different rules apply to teaching in [Wales](https://www.ewc.wales/site/index.php/en/registration/practitioners-trained-outside-wales.html), [Scotland](https://www.ewc.wales/site/index.php/en/registration/practitioners-trained-outside-wales.html) and [Northern Ireland](https://gtcni.org.uk/registration/getting-registered).

## Other routes to qualified teacher status (QTS) and teaching in England.

If you already have a teaching qualification, you should consider alternative routes to QTS, which are outlined in [Qualified teacher status: routes to QTS for teachers and those with teaching experience outside the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualified-teacher-status-routes-to-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk/qualified-teacher-status-routes-to-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk).

[Come to England to teach if you're a teacher from outside the UK](/come-to-england-to-teach-if-you-are-a-teacher-from-outside-the-uk) gives information and advice to international teachers who’d like to teach in England.
