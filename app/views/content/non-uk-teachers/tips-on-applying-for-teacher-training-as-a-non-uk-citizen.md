If you’re applying for teacher training as a non-UK citizen, the process may be different to that for UK citizens. 

Read our tips and guidance to increase your chances of success. 

## Check you can afford to train to teach 

Fees are higher for non-UK citizens and you’re unlikely to get financial support. [Learn more about fees and any funding you may be eligible for.](/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-uk-trainees)  

## Get school experience 

Consider getting experience in a school. This will help you understand if teaching is right for you and give you an insight into teaching. You can [write about your school experience in your personal statement](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-personal-statement).  

If you’re in the UK and your visa allows it, you can get help [finding unpaid work experience in schools](/is-teaching-right-for-me/get-school-experience).  

If you’re outside the UK, you could contact local schools to ask about work experience opportunities.

## Apply for teacher training before you apply for your visa

If you’re a non-UK citizen, you will need a visa or immigration status giving you the right to study or work in the UK. 

If you don’t already have the right to study or work in the UK, before you apply for your visa, you must have a confirmed offer of a training place from a provider who can sponsor visas. 

[Learn more about applying for your visa](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees).

## Apply to train as early as you can 

For your teacher training place offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to pass criminal record checks, so we recommend applying early. You can apply for teacher training from October, for courses starting the following year in September or January. 

You can prepare by:  

* [applying for a criminal record check](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants) from the appropriate authority in your country 

* [getting your references ready](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-references)  

  
## Ways to train 

You can train in a school or in a university setting, and study full-time (over a year) or part-time (over 2 or more years).  

Teacher training courses can also be: 

* ‘fee-paying’ – you [pay a fee to study](/funding-and-support/tuition-fees) 

* ‘salaried’– you are [paid to work in a school while you study](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training)

### Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships

If you are resident in the UK, you may be eligible to apply for a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship. This allows you to earn a salary while you train.

To apply, you will need to meet both the following conditions:

* you must have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme
* you must have been living in the UK or the [EEA](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship

If you do not have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you will need to meet both the following conditions:

* you must apply for a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK
* you must have been living in the UK for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship

If you are resident in the UK, you may already have a visa or immigration status allowing you to work – for example, a Graduate visa. 

If you need to apply for another visa – for example, a Skilled Worker visa – you’ll need to do this after you’ve been given a place on a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship.

### If you don't have a bachelor’s degree

If you don’t have a bachelor’s degree, you can explore [other routes into teacher training](/non-uk-teachers/non-uk-qualifications/#if-you-do-not-have-a-bachelors-degree). 

## Choosing a subject to teach 

The subject you apply to teach must usually be the same as, or closely related to, the subject you studied at university. For example, engineering graduates can apply to train to teach physics, but computer science graduates are unlikely to be accepted to train to teach geography. 

A [subject knowledge enhancement course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement) can help. 

## Choosing an age group to teach 

Schools in England are divided into: 

* [primary (ages 5 to 11)](/is-teaching-right-for-me/who-do-you-want-to-teach/#primary-ages-5-to-11) 

* [secondary (ages 11 to 18)](/is-teaching-right-for-me/who-do-you-want-to-teach/#secondary-ages-11-to-18) 

You can also teach children with [special educational needs](/is-teaching-right-for-me/teach-disabled-pupils-and-pupils-with-special-educational-needs). 

## Finding the right course for you  

[Find postgraduate teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses) lists courses leading to [English qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts). 

If you need a visa, remember to filter your search results by 'visa sponsorship'. 

You can also search courses by: 

* location 

* teaching subject 

* age group 

* courses which pay a salary 

Email your chosen provider to check they can sponsor you, then apply for your teacher training course.
