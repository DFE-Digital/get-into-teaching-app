Before you apply for teacher training in England, you must check that you have [the right qualifications](#qualifications-youll-need-to-train-to-teach) and they meet the standard set for English teacher training. 
 
## How to check your qualifications

The simplest way to check your qualifications meet the required standard in England is to get a [statement of comparability](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx) from the UK European Network of Information Centres (UK ENIC). 

This is a certificate that proves your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK bachelor's degree.

When you apply for teacher training, you'll be asked to submit details of your statement of comparability. Applications which include this are 28% more likely to be successful. 

A statement of comparability costs £49.50 + VAT. It takes 15 working days to complete your order from the date ENIC receives your qualification documents and payment.

## Get help checking your qualifications

To get help with your qualifications, you can use the live chat service at the bottom of this page. Or you can call us on +44 800 389 2500. Calls will be charged at your country's standard rate.

We're available Monday to Friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm (UK local time) except on [bank holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays) in England. 

When you speak to us, we can tell you if you're eligible for a [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers). 


## Qualifications you'll need to train to teach

To train to teach in England, you'll need:

* a degree which meets the standard of a UK bachelor’s degree (this can come from a non-UK university)
* an English language qualification which meets the standard of a grade 4 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) – a qualification awarded for exams taken at age 16 in England
* a maths qualification which meets the standard of a grade 4 GCSE
* if teaching children aged 3 to 11 in primary school, a physics, chemistry or biology (science) qualification which meets the standard of a grade 4 GCSE

You'll also need to:

* complete a fitness questionnaire before starting training
* undergo safeguarding and criminal record checks carried out by your training provider or employer

## English language, maths and science proficiency

If you’ve reached a certain proficiency in an English language test, you can use this as evidence you meet the standard of a grade 4 GCSE in English – for example: 

* [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://www.ielts.org/)
* [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/toefl)
* [C2 Proficiency, formerly known as Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE)](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/proficiency/)  

If you have not passed an English language test like this, or do not have qualifications in maths or science which are the same standard as grade 4 GCSE, some teacher training providers will let you sit tests in these subjects. It’s best to contact them to ask about their policy before you apply. 

## If you do not have a bachelor's degree

If you do not have a degree, you can apply to study a 3 to 4 year [undergraduate course in England](https://www.ucas.com/postgraduate/teacher-training/applying-teacher-training/find-teacher-training-programmes) which combines a teaching degree with [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts). When you complete your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.

The [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/) has lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.
