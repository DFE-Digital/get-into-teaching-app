Before you apply for teacher training in England, you must check that you have the [the right qualifications](#qualifications-you-will-need-to-train-to-teach) and they meet the standard set for English teacher training. 
 
## How to validate your qualifications

The simplest way to check your qualifications meet the required standard is to get a [statement of comparability](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx) from the UK European Network of Information Centres (UK ENIC). 

This is a certificate costing £49.50 + VAT that proves your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK undergraduate degree. It takes 15 working days to complete your order from the date ENIC receives your qualification documents and payment.

When you apply for teacher training, you'll be asked to submit details of your statement of comparability. Teacher training providers will then be confident you meet the qualification entry requirements. 


## Get help checking your qualifications

You can also contact us for advice about your qualifications. Before applying, you can:

* sign up to [get a teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-adviser/sign_up/identity) – you’ll be asked for your phone number, email and location so a dedicated adviser can call you back in your time zone
* call +44 800 389 2500, Monday to Friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm (UK local time) except on [bank holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays) in England - calls will be charged at your standard rate
* use the live chat service at the bottom of this page

We can help you with a free digital e-statement of comparability, once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this.


## Qualifications you will need to train to teach

To train to teach in England, you will need:

* a degree which meets the standard of a UK bachelor’s degree (this can come from a non-UK university)
* an English language qualification which meets the standard of a grade 4 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE)
* a maths qualification which meets the standard of a grade 4 GCSE
* if teaching children aged 3 to 11 in primary school, a physics, chemistry or biology (science) qualification which meets the standard of a grade 4 GCSE

A GCSE is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16.

You will also need to:

* have the health and physical capacity to train to teach
* undergo safeguarding and criminal record checks carried out by your training provider or employer

## English language, maths and science proficiency

Your English language qualification could be evidence you’ve reached a certain standard in an English language test, for example one of the following: 

* the [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://www.ielts.org/)
* [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/toefl)
* [C2 Proficiency, formerly known as Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE)](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/proficiency/)  

If you haven’t passed an English language test like this, or do not have qualifications in maths or science which are the same standard as grade 4 GCSE, some teacher training providers will let you sit tests in these subjects. It’s best to contact them to ask about their policy before you apply. 

## If you do not have a university degree

If you do not have a degree, you can apply to study a 3 to 4 year [undergraduate course in England](https://www.ucas.com/postgraduate/teacher-training/applying-teacher-training/find-teacher-training-programmes) which combines a teaching degree with [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts). When you complete your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.

The [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/) has lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.
