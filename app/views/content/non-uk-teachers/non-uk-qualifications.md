Before you apply for teacher training in England, you must check that you have the right qualifications. If you gained your qualifications outside the UK, we can help you check they meet the required standard. 

## Already a qualified teacher?

If you're already a qualified teacher, find out how you can [teach in England if you completed your teacher training outside the UK](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas).

## Check your eligibility

To train to teach in England, you will need:

* a bachelor’s degree (this can be from a university outside the UK)
* an English language qualification which is the same standard as a grade 4 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE)
* a maths qualification which is the same standard as a grade 4 GCSE
* if teaching children aged 3 to 11 in primary school, a physics, chemistry or biology (science) qualification which is the same standard as a grade 4 GCSE

A GCSE is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16.

You will also need to:

* have the health and physical capacity to train to teach
* undergo safeguarding and criminal record checks carried out by your training provider or employer

## Help comparing English and international qualifications

We can check your degree and other qualifications meet the standards set for English teacher training. 

For help, you can:

* sign up to [get a teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-adviser/sign_up/identity) – you’ll be asked for your phone number, email and location so a dedicated adviser can call you back in your time zone
* call +44 800 389 2500, Monday to Friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm (UK local time) except on [bank holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays) in England - calls will be charged at your standard rate
* use the live chat service at the bottom of this page


When you make your application for teacher training, some teacher training providers will want to see a [statement of comparability](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx) from the UK European Network of Information Centres (UK ENIC). 

A statement of comparability proves that your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK undergraduate degree. We can help you with a free digital e-statement of comparability, once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this.


## English language, maths and science proficiency

Your English language qualification could be evidence you’ve reached a certain standard in an English language test, for example one of the following: 

* the [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://www.ielts.org/)
* [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/toefl)
* [C2 Proficiency, formerly known as Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE)](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/proficiency/)  

If you haven’t passed an English language test like this, or do not have qualifications in maths or science which are the same standard as grade 4 GCSE, some teacher training providers will let you sit tests in these subjects. It’s best to contact them to ask about their policy before you apply. 

## If you do not have a university degree

If you do not have a degree, you can apply to study a 3 to 4 year [undergraduate course in England](https://www.ucas.com/postgraduate/teacher-training/applying-teacher-training/find-teacher-training-programmes) which combines a teaching degree with [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts). When you complete your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.

The [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/) has lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.
