The information on this page is for:

* [non-UK teachers of languages, physics and general or combined science when it includes physics](#criteria-for-teachers)
* [non-UK trainee teachers of languages and physics](#criteria-for-trainee-teachers-fee-paying-and-salaried)   

If you are considering coming to England to teach or train to teach languages or physics, you could be eligible for financial help from the UK government worth £10,000.  

The international relocation payment (IRP) is designed to cover some of the costs of moving to England, including:

* the costs of visas

* the immigration health surcharge

* other relocation expenses

All eligible applicants will receive a single payment of £10,000 from the Department for Education around the end of their first term training or working in England. The IRP is a grant – you will not have to pay this money back. You can only receive the IRP once.

However, [the application process for the IRP is different for salaried trainees](#how-trainee-teachers-can-get-the-international-relocation-payment).

You will still be eligible for the international relocation payment if your course leads to PGCE and QTS or PGDE and QTS.

You can contact your teacher training provider to check:

* the course you have chosen is eligible for the international relocation payment

* the content of your teacher training course meets the 50% requirement

### 2. Degree requirements for trainees

Your chosen teacher training provider will be able to tell you whether your university and degree meet the standard and subject criteria for the international relocation payment.

## How trainee teachers can get the international relocation payment

### Fee-paying trainees

If you have a place on a teacher training course where you pay a fee, you do not need to apply for the international relocation payment (IRP). Your training provider will tell you if your choice of course and bachelor's degree make you eligible for the IRP. Your visa status and date of arrival will be checked by the Department for Education. If you are eligible, you’ll get the IRP around the end of your first term.

If you believe you meet the eligibility requirements, but have not been informed by your teacher training provider that you may be awarded the IRP, please contact your training provider directly first. If your training provider cannot help you, you can email us at teach.inengland@education.gov.uk.

### Salaried trainees

Applications for the [international relocation payment (IRP)](https://get-a-teacher-relocation-payment.education.gov.uk) for salaried trainees are now closed. They will reopen between 2 April and 31 May 2024. 

To remain eligible for the IRP, you must apply in either the first or second term of your teacher training course. 

If you have not yet started your salaried teacher training course, you can express your interest in the IRP by emailing us at IRP.ExpressInterest@education.gov.uk. We will email you when applications reopen later in 2024.

## General information about the international relocation payment  

### Protect yourself from fraud

Teachers and salaried trainee teachers will not need to pay an agent or any other third party to complete their application. Any agency or person contacting you offering to apply for the IRP on your behalf is likely to be fraudulent. [Avoid and report internet scams and phishing](https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing).

### Visiting the UK more than 3 months before the start of your course or job

Your eligibility for the international relocation payment (IRP) will not be affected if you spend short periods in the UK at a time more than 3 months before the start of your course or job.

Example 1: You travel to attend a job interview in the UK under a Standard Visitor visa in May 2024. You return home, and learn you have been given the job, which starts in September 2024. You apply for a Skilled Worker visa in June 2024, 3 months before the start of your job. You move to the UK in July 2024. You will still be eligible for the IRP.

Example 2: You have a UK Ancestry visa and use it to visit relations in the UK in February 2024. You return home and successfully apply for a place on a teacher training course starting in September 2024. You move to the UK in June 2024. You will still be eligible for the IRP.

You will also still be eligible for the IRP if you live in another part of the UK (for example, Scotland or Wales) as long as you are employed in a school in England.  

If you are in any doubt about meeting the 3-month requirement, please email us for advice before planning your move.

### Using the international relocation payment to support your visa application

You will not be able to use eligibility for the international relocation payment in your visa application as proof that you have enough money to support yourself.

### Subject eligibility  

The international relocation payment (IRP) has been limited to languages and physics because non-UK teachers play an important part in teaching these priority subjects. The Department for Education is piloting the IRP to encourage more non-UK teachers and trainees in these subjects to bring their skills, experience and potential to English schools.

### Payment

The international relocation payment (IRP) cannot be paid to you in advance, before you take up your teacher training place or teaching job. This is because eligibility requirement checks can only be completed after you’ve arrived in England. 

In order to be paid the IRP, you must have a UK bank account in your name (this can be digital). The IRP cannot be paid into a building society account (building societies are financial institutions owned by members that offer banking services). 

If you are a teacher or a salaried teacher trainee, you must also have a [UK National Insurance number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number). You can apply for this once you arrive in England, as long as your visa gives you the right to work and you have a confirmed job.  

Teachers and salaried trainees should receive a single payment from the Department for Education shortly after the end of the term of employment as a teacher in which they apply. Fee-paying trainees will receive a single payment from their provider around the end of the term of training in which they apply. You'll be paid as and when your eligibility requirements have been checked – we cannot guarantee an exact payment date.  

You will not have to justify any expenses or give us receipts or any other evidence of the relocation costs you have incurred.  

If your details, such as your address, change after you have applied, please inform us as soon as possible to avoid any delay to your payment. 

The Department for Education reserves the right to withhold payment if you are no longer studying on an eligible course or employed in an eligible job on the payment date.

If you were eligible for and have received the international relocation payment, you will not be asked to pay it back, even if you leave England, your training course or your job as a teacher.

### Tax

If you are on a fee-paying teacher training course, you will not have to pay tax on the international relocation payment (IRP).  

If you are a teacher, or a trainee on a salaried course, the Department for Education will pay the UK tax owed on the IRP to ensure you receive the full £10,000, as long as your overall earnings do not exceed £50,270 in the year you receive the IRP. You may have to pay higher rate [UK Income Tax](https://www.gov.uk/browse/tax/income-tax) on any earnings which take you over £50,270.

### Part-time teachers and trainees

Part-time teachers and trainees will receive the international relocation payment in full, as long as they meet all the eligibility criteria.

### Other types of financial support from the UK government  

Teachers and recently qualified trainees who meet the eligibility requirements can also apply for the following payments in addition to the international relocation payment (IRP):

* [the levelling up premium payment](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/levelling-up-premium-payments-for-teachers)  
* [early career payments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-career-payments-guidance-for-teachers-and-schools)  

However, you should be aware that you can only receive the IRP once, and you cannot receive both the levelling up premium payment and the early career payment in the same year.

This means that teachers in their first year of employment in England could receive either the IRP and the levelling up premium payment, or the IRP and the early career payment.

Trainee teachers could receive the IRP in their training year in England, and either the levelling up premium payment, or the early career payment in their first year of work as a teacher.  

## Contact us

For general enquiries about the IRP, please email us at teach.inengland@education.gov.uk.

Please do not send us your CV or enquiries about training places or teaching jobs, as the Department for Education does not directly run training courses or employ teachers.
