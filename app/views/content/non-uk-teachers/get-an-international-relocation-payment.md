The information on this page is for: 

* non-UK teachers of languages and physics 
* non-UK trainee teachers of languages and physics   

If you are considering coming to England to teach or train to teach languages or physics, you could be eligible for financial help from the UK government worth £10,000.  

The international relocation payment (IRP) is designed to repay some of the costs of moving to England, including: 

* the costs of visas 

* the immigration health surcharge 

* other relocation expenses 

If you are eligible, you’ll receive a single payment of £10,000 from the Department for Education (DfE) around the end of your first term training or working in England. You will not have to pay this money back. You can only receive the IRP once. 

## How to apply 

The process of applying for the international relocation payment is different for trainee teachers and teachers.  
 
## Criteria for trainee teachers  

As a trainee teacher, to be eligible for the international relocation payment (IRP), you must meet all 3 of the following requirements.

### 1. Teaching subject (trainees)
 
You must have taken up a place on a teacher training course in England leading to [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) for the academic year 2023 to 2024.

* any secondary language or languages, including courses with content which is at least 50% languages – you can combine training to teach English with another language, as long as the non-English language makes up at least 50% of your course

You will still be eligible for the international relocation payment if your course leads to PGCE + QTS or PGDE + QTS. 

You can contact your teacher training provider to check: 
 
* the course you have chosen is eligible for the international relocation payment

## How trainee teachers can get the international relocation payment 

### Fee-paying trainees 

If you have a place on a teacher training course where you pay a fee, you do not need to apply for the international relocation payment (IRP). Your training provider will email you if your choice of course makes you eligible for the IRP. Your visa status and date of arrival will be checked by the Department for Education. If you are eligible, you’ll get the IRP around the end of your first term. 

If you believe you meet the eligibility requirements, but have not been informed by your teacher training provider that you may be awarded the IRP, please contact your training provider directly first. If your training provider cannot help you, you can email us at teach.inengland@education.gov.uk. 

### Salaried trainees 

If you have a place on a teacher training course where you are paid a salary to work while you train, email us at IRP.ExpressInterest@education.gov.uk to let us know you are interested in applying for the IRP. You will be asked to fill in a form giving us your details and we’ll get in touch when IRP applications open for salaried trainees in autumn 2023. If you are eligible, you’ll get the IRP around the end of your first term. 

## Criteria for teachers  

To be eligible for the international relocation payment (IRP), you must meet all 3 of the following requirements.

### 1. Teaching subject (teachers)

You must have accepted a job as a teacher of languages or physics in an English state secondary school on a contract lasting at least one academic year.  

Teachers of all languages offered in English state secondary schools are eligible to apply for the IRP. The language or languages can be combined with another subject, but must make up at least 50% of teaching time. You can combine teaching English with another language, as long as the non-English language makes up at least 50% of your teaching timetable.  

Physics can be taught with another subject, but must make up at least 50% of teaching time. Teachers of general science or combined science  are also eligible to apply for the IRP, as long as they are teaching the physics element of general science or combined science. General science or combined science can be taught with another subject, but must make up at least 50% of teaching time.  

'State schools' are schools funded by the UK government. 'Secondary schools' teach children aged 11 to 16 or 11 to 18. You will not be eligible if you teach in a school for pupils aged 16 to 18 only.  

An academic year is 3 full school terms: for example, if your teaching job started in September 2023 (the start of the autumn term), it would need to continue until July 2024 (covering the spring and summer terms). 

[Check the type and age range of the school](https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) where you’ll be teaching. You can also find out about the [different types of state school in England](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school).

## How teachers can apply for the international relocation payment 

You’ll need to have started your teaching job in a state secondary school to make your application for the international relocation payment (IRP). [Learn more about finding a teaching job and applying for your visa](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas). 

You will be able to apply for the IRP from 1 September to 31 October 2023. You can email us at IRP.ExpressInterest@education.gov.uk to let us know you are interested in applying for the IRP. You will be asked to fill in a form giving us your details and we’ll get in touch when IRP applications open. If you are eligible, you’ll receive the money around the end of your first school term of employment. 

For information about IRP applications in 2024, check back to this page. 

## General information about the international relocation payment  

Further information for trainees and teachers.

### Protect yourself from fraud 

Teachers and salaried trainee teachers will not need to pay an agent or any other third party to complete their application. Any agency or person contacting you offering to apply for the IRP on your behalf is likely to be fraudulent. [Avoid and report internet scams and phishing](https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing). 

### Visiting England more than 3 months before the start of your course or job 

Your eligibility for the international relocation payment (IRP) will not be affected if you spend short periods in England at a time more than 3 months before the start of your course or job. 

Example 1: You attend a job interview in England under a Standard Visitor visa in May 2023. You return home, and learn you have been given the job, which starts in September 2023. You apply for a Skilled worker visa in June 2023, 3 months before the start of your job. You move to England in July 2023. You will still be eligible for the IRP. 

Example 2: You have a UK Ancestry visa and use it to visit relations in England in February 2023. You return home and successfully apply for a place on a teacher training course starting in September 2023. You move to England in June 2023. You will still be eligible for the IRP. 

You will also still be eligible for the IRP if you live in another part of the UK (for example, Scotland or Wales) as long as you are employed in a school in England.  

If you are in any doubt about meeting the 3-month requirement, please email us for advice before planning your move. 

### Subject eligibility  

The international relocation payment (IRP) has been limited to languages and physics because non-UK teachers play an important part in teaching these priority subjects. The Department for Education is piloting the IRP to encourage more non-UK teachers and trainees to bring their skills, experience and potential to English schools. 

### Payment 

Eligibility requirement checks can only be completed after you’ve arrived in England. Therefore, the international relocation payment (IRP) cannot be made before you take up your teacher training place or teaching job. 

In order to be paid the IRP, you must have a UK bank account (this can be digital). If you are a teacher or a salaried teacher trainee, you must also have a [UK National Insurance number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number). You can apply for this once you arrive in England, as long as your visa gives you the right to work and you have a confirmed job.  

You will receive a single payment from the Department for Education around the end of your first term of training or employment. You will be paid as and when your eligibility requirements have been checked – we cannot guarantee an exact payment date.  

You will not have to justify any expenses or give us receipts or any other evidence of the relocation costs you have incurred.  

The Department for Education reserves the right to withhold payment if you are no longer studying on an eligible course or employed in an eligible job on the payment date. 

### Tax 

The Department for Education will pay the UK tax owed on the international relocation payment to ensure you receive the full £10,000, as long as your overall earnings do not exceed £50,270 a year in 2023/24. You may have to pay higher rate [UK Income Tax](https://www.gov.uk/browse/tax/income-tax) and [UK National Insurance](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance) on any earnings which take you over £50,270. 

### Part-time teachers and trainees 

Part-time teachers and trainees will receive the international relocation payment in full, as long as they meet all the eligibility criteria. 

### Leaving England, your training course or job 

Once you have received the international relocation payment, you will not be asked to pay it back, even if you leave England, your training course or your job as a teacher.  

### Other types of financial support from the UK government  

Teachers and newly qualified trainees who meet the eligibility requirements can also apply for the following payments in addition to the international relocation payment (IRP): 

* [the levelling up premium payment](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/levelling-up-premium-payments-for-teachers)  
* [early career payments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-career-payments-guidance-for-teachers-and-schools)  

However, you should be aware that you can only receive the IRP once, and you cannot receive both the levelling up premium payment and the early career payment in the same year. 

This means that teachers in their first year of employment in England could receive either the IRP and the levelling up premium payment, or the IRP and the early career payment. 

Trainee teachers could receive the IRP in their training year in England, and either the levelling up premium payment, or the early career payment in their first year of work as a teacher.  

## Contact us 

Please don’t send us your CV or enquiries about training places or teaching jobs, as the Department for Education does not directly run training courses or employ teachers. 

[Non-UK teachers](/non-uk-teachers) gives more information about training to teach or working as a teacher in England.
