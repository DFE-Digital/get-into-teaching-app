$new-international-funding$

Teaching in England offers exciting opportunities, including:

* a [competitive salary](/life-as-a-teacher/pay-and-benefits/teacher-pay)
* support in your professional development
* varied job roles

You will need English [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) to teach in most schools in England. QTS is a professional teaching qualification that teachers in England gain at the end of their training. 

You will also need a high standard of written and spoken English to teach in England. 

$ukraine-moving$

## If you do not have qualified teacher status

If you do not have QTS, schools will want to see alternative evidence of your teaching and academic qualifications. 

You can get a [statement of comparability from the UK information centre for international qualifications and skills](https://www.enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx). This will show how your qualifications compare to English ones. 

If you are a qualified teacher from outside the UK, you can work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS.  After that, you will need QTS to teach in many schools in England.

## Visas for non-UK teachers

To teach in England, you will need a Skilled Worker visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK. 

If you need a Skilled Worker visa, you will need to apply for teaching jobs that offer visa sponsorship. If you are offered a job, you can then apply for your visa. 

$teachervisa$

## Applying for teaching jobs in England
You must apply to individual schools, not the Department for Education (DfE). DfE does not appoint teachers and does not offer teaching jobs. 

$sponsjobs$

## Safeguarding checks
If a school offers you a job, you will have to pass safeguarding and criminal records checks. These confirm you are a safe and suitable person to work with children. 

You can prepare for these checks by getting a letter from the organisation which regulates teachers in the country where you qualified, confirming your professional status as a teacher. 

## Financial support

You may be eligible for:

* a [levelling up premium payment](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/levelling-up-premium-payments-for-teachers) if you teach chemistry, computing, maths or physics 

* the [international relocation payment (IRP)](/non-uk-teachers/get-an-international-relocation-payment) if you teach languages or physics
