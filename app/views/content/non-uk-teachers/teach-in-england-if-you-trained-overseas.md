Teach in England and you’ll benefit from working in a world-class education system.

You’ll earn a [competitive salary](/salaries-and-benefits), get supported in your professional development and have varied job opportunities.

You could also consider teaching in [Wales](https://educators.wales), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).

Not qualified as a teacher yet? Find out [how to train to teach in England as a non-UK citizen](/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student). If you don't want to come to England to train, you should consider [international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status), which leads to the automatic award of English qualified teacher status. 

## What you'll need to teach in England

If you are already a qualified teacher, you do not need to retrain to teach in England. However, you will need:

* to apply for English 'qualified teacher status', or be able to demonstrate strong non-UK qualifications and experience 
* a high standard of written and spoken English
* to pass criminal and professional safeguarding checks (these will be organised by your employer)
* a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK

## Get an international relocation payment (IRP) worth £10,000

If you are interested in moving to the UK to teach languages or physics in an English secondary school, you could be eligible for a cash sum of £10,000 from the UK government to help with moving expenses, including visa costs and the [immigration health surcharge](https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application). 

The international relocation payment (IRP) will be available to non-UK citizens starting work in English schools in the academic year September 2023 to July 2024. You will not have to pay this money back and it can be spent in any way you wish. You can only receive the IRP once.

### Check your eligibility for the IRP

To be eligible, teachers must meet all 3 of the following requirements.

You must have accepted a languages or physics teaching job in an [English state secondary school](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school) on a contract lasting at least one academic year. 

Teachers of all languages (except English) offered in English state secondary schools are eligible to apply for the IRP. The language or languages can be combined with another subject, but must make up at least 50% of teaching time.

Physics can be combined with another subject, but must make up at least 50% of teaching time. Teachers of general science are also eligible to apply for the IRP if they are teaching the physics elements of general science. It can be combined with another subject, but general science must make up at least 50% of teaching time.

You must come to the UK on one of the following visas: 

* Skilled worker visa
* Youth Mobility Scheme 
* Family visa
* UK Ancestry visa 
* British National (Overseas) visa
* High Potential Individual visa 
* Afghan citizens resettlement scheme
* Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy
* Ukraine Family Scheme visa
* Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme


You must move to the UK no more than 3 months before the start of your job. 

You will not be eligible for the IRP if you are already living in the UK. 
 


### How to apply for the IRP

You’ll need to have started your teaching job in a state secondary school to make your application – the guidance on this page explains how to find a teaching job and apply for your visa. 

Applications will be open from 1 September to 31 October 2023. To express your interest in applying, email us at IRP.ExpressInterest@education.gov.uk. For information about applications in 2024, check back to this page.

If your application is successful, you’ll receive the money around the end of your first school term of employment.

## Apply for qualified teacher status (QTS)

Qualified teacher status (QTS) is the professional status teachers in England gain at the end of their teacher training. Schools use QTS as a measure of teaching skills and experience, so you will find it much easier to get a teaching job in England if you have QTS.

However, if you’re a qualified teacher from outside the UK, you can [work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#qts-exemption-for-teachers-from-outside-the-uk).

After that, you will need QTS to teach in many schools in England, although it is not a legal requirement in some types of school (for example, [academy schools, free schools and private schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)). 

It’s important to note that, even if you decide to apply for QTS, you will have to apply for your teaching job and your visa separately. 

### How to apply for QTS

From 1 February 2023, if you have a teaching qualification from the following countries and regions, you will be able to access a new service, called [Apply for qualified teacher status in England](https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/eligibility/start), to check if you meet the requirements for QTS:


* Australia
* Canada
* the EEA
* Gibraltar
* Hong Kong
* New Zealand
* Northern Ireland
* Scotland
* Switzerland
* Ukraine
* the USA

In addition, if you have a subject specialism in languages, mathematics or science and a teaching qualification to teach to teach 11 to 16 year olds from the following countries, you will be able to use the service to check if you meet the requirements for QTS: 

* Ghana
* India
* Jamaica
* Nigeria
* Singapore
* South Africa
* Zimbabwe

You will not have to pay a fee or undergo further training. However, to be awarded QTS you will need to meet certain criteria. [Learn more about the qualifications and experience you'll need to get QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/awarding-qualified-teacher-status-to-overseas-teachers). 

<p class="call-to-action__action">
  <a href="https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/eligibility/start">Apply for QTS <span>in England</span></a>
</p>


If you’re not eligible to use the new service, you may be able to:

* [complete initial teacher training in England](/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student)
* [apply for international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status)


## Find a teaching job

Once you've obtained QTS, you will need to find a teaching job in England. To do this, you must apply to individual schools (not the Department for Education). 

### Your professional qualifications 

If you haven't got QTS, schools you apply to will want to see alternative evidence of your teaching and academic qualifications. You can [get a statement of comparability from the UK information centre for international qualifications and skills](https://www.enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx) showing how your qualifications compare to English ones.  

You can search and apply for jobs by region, subject specialism and age group. Most teaching vacancies are advertised in March, April or the first half of May, with jobs usually starting at the beginning of the school year in September. 

Select a job to apply for, and contact the school to check they are open to sponsoring skilled worker visas. Submit your application, and if you are offered the job, you’ll then be able to apply for your visa.


You can set up a job alert to be updated about opportunities throughout the year.

## Apply for your visa

You can apply for a skilled worker visa once you have been offered a teaching job at a school which can sponsor them. Find out [how to apply for a skilled worker visa, what salary you will need to earn and other types of visa you may be eligible for](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk#visas-and-immigration). 

You may have a pre-existing right to work in the UK, such as settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk).

[If you're an Irish citizen you do not need a visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance).

If you’re not sure about your immigration status, you can [check if you need a UK visa](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa) or [contact UK Visas and Immigration for help](https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk).

You can also learn more about [bringing your partner and children](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/your-partner-and-children).


## Learn about life as a teacher in England

You may be asked about your knowledge of English education in interviews for teaching jobs. To prepare, you can [read other teachers’ stories](/blog) and research the [English curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum) and [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards). 


If you’ve successfully [applied for QTS in England](https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/eligibility/start), and have less than 2 years’ teaching experience, you can get valuable support and mentoring through the [early career framework](/support-for-early-career-teachers).
