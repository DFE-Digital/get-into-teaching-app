International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a new teaching qualification backed by the UK government. iQTS meets the same high standards as [English qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts), and leads to the automatic award of QTS. You can train where you live and work, with no need to visit the UK.

## Why choose iQTS?

iQTS is offered by world-class English teacher training providers working with schools in countries around the world. Alongside online tutorials and lectures, you’ll spend a minimum of 120 days gaining practical experience in a school in your region, and get in-person support from a trained mentor.

iQTS allows you to train to teach children aged 5 to 11, or children aged 11 to 18 in the full range of [secondary school subjects taught in English schools](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum).

When you complete the course, you’ll have the skills, experience and knowledge to become an excellent teacher. You will also automatically be awarded English qualified teacher status (QTS) with no further fees or training. QTS is recognised all over the world as a teaching gold standard and will also qualify you to teach in England.

If you decide to [teach in England](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas), as an early career teacher you’ll benefit from a two-year induction period alongside your work in school. You’ll earn a salary and get mentoring and continuous professional development to help you succeed as a teacher.

## Entry requirements

Both UK and non-UK citizens can apply for iQTS – however, you must be living outside England.

You will also need to have:

* a bachelor’s degree from a UK or non-UK university (or other institution)

* a maths qualification of the same standard as GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) grade 4

* for teaching children aged 3 to 11, a science qualification of the same standard as GCSE grade 4

* excellent written and verbal English language skills

You do not need any teaching experience or to be working in a school to apply for iQTS.

To show you meet the required standard in the English language, you’ll need one of the following:

* an [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://www.ielts.org/) score of 6.5 or higher

* the equivalent score in another English language testing system

* to have completed some of your education in the English language, for example, a degree studied in English

### Help with qualifications

A GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16.

If you’re not sure whether your qualifications meet the entry requirements for iQTS, you can apply for a statement of comparability from [UK ENIC](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx), the UK National Information Centre for global qualifications and skills. A statement of comparability proves that your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK bachelor's degree.

## Fees

Fees range from $fees_iQTS_low$ to $fees_iQTS_high$ for a one-year, full-time iQTS course. Check training provider websites for full details.

Applicants for iQTS are not eligible for loans, bursaries or any other type of financial support from the UK government to help cover the costs of studying iQTS.

To find out about scholarship opportunities, contact your chosen iQTS training provider directly.

## Placement schools and working while you train

iQTS is delivered by English training providers working in close partnership with schools outside the UK. These placement schools offer iQTS trainees practical experience and in-person mentoring.

Some training providers will already have relationships with schools in your region and will be able to match you to a particular school. Others will make it an entry requirement for their course that you set up your own placement with a local school.

If you are already employed in a school, you can discuss with your training provider whether you can continue working in that school while you complete your iQTS qualification.

To learn more, contact your chosen iQTS provider directly.

## Other routes to QTS

iQTS is an international teaching qualification designed for UK and non-UK citizens living outside England.

If you’re living in England and want a teaching qualification leading to QTS, you must [apply for teacher training in England](/steps-to-become-a-teacher).

If you’re already qualified as a teacher or have teaching experience, other routes to qualified teacher status (QTS) may be faster and more affordable.

Qualified teachers should check their eligibility to [apply for QTS in England](https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/eligibility/start).

If you have no teaching qualification but lots of experience, you should check your eligibility for [assessment only QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#apply-for-assessment-only-qts).

## Teaching in England

If you successfully complete your iQTS course, you will be qualified to teach in England. It’s important to note that you will also have to apply for a teaching job and a visa, unless you already have an immigration status allowing you to work in the UK.

[Teach in England](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas) gives more information.

## Early career teacher induction

If you choose to teach in England, as an early career teacher you’ll benefit from a two-year induction period alongside your work in school. You’ll earn a salary and get mentoring and continuous professional development to help you succeed as a teacher.

While induction is a requirement to teach in most schools in England, you do not need to complete an induction period to teach outside the UK. However, if you wish, you can choose to complete your early career teacher induction at a [Department for Education-accredited British School Overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-schools-overseas-inspection-reports/british-schools-overseas-accredited-schools-inspection-reports).
