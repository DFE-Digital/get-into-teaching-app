International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a teaching qualification that's the equivalent of [English qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts). iQTS enables you to train to teach in the country where you live and work, with no need to visit England.

## Why choose iQTS?

iQTS is offered by teacher training providers in England that work with schools around the world. Alongside online tutorials and lectures, you’ll spend a minimum of 120 days gaining practical experience in a school in your country. You'll also get in-person support from a trained mentor.

iQTS allows you to train to teach pupils aged 5 to 11, or pupils 11 to 18 in the full range of [secondary school subjects taught in English schools](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum).

When you complete the course, you’ll have the skills, experience and knowledge to become an excellent teacher. 


## Entry requirements for iQTS

Both UK and non-UK citizens can apply for iQTS, but you must be living outside of England.

You do not need any teaching experience or to be working in a school to apply for iQTS.

You'll need to have:

* a bachelor’s degree from a UK or non-UK university (or other institution)

* a maths qualification of the same standard as GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) grade 4 (C)

* for teaching pupils aged 3 to 11, a science qualification of the same standard as GCSE grade 4 (C)

A GCSE is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at the age of 16.

You’ll need to have excellent written and verbal English language skills. To show this, you'll need one of the following:

* an [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://www.ielts.org/) score of 6.5 or higher, or the equivalent score in another English language testing system

* to have completed some of your education in the English language, for example, a degree studied in English

### Help with qualifications

To find out whether your qualifications meet the entry requirements for iQTS, you can [apply for a statement of comparability on the UK ENIC website](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx), the UK National Information Centre for global qualifications and skills. A statement of comparability proves that your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK bachelor's degree.

## Tuition fees for iQTS

Fees range from $fees_iQTS_low$ to $fees_iQTS_high$ for a one-year, full-time iQTS course. Check training provider websites for full details.

Applicants for iQTS are not eligible for loans, bursaries or any other type of financial support from the Department for Education and Student Finance England to help cover the costs of studying for iQTS.

To find out about scholarship opportunities, contact your chosen iQTS training provider directly.

## Placement schools and working while you train

iQTS is delivered by English training providers working in close partnership with schools outside of England. These placement schools offer iQTS trainees practical experience and in-person mentoring.

Some training providers will already have relationships with schools in your region and can match you to a school. Others will make it an entry requirement for their course that you set up your own placement with a local school.

If you're already employed in a school, you can talk to your training provider about whether you can continue working in that school while you complete your iQTS.

To learn more, contact your chosen iQTS provider directly.

## How to apply for iQTS

All iQTS training providers are approved by the UK government and must meet the same strict standards. However, they may vary in their approach to:

* fees

* placement schools and working while you train

* application process and entry requirements

* the regions and countries around the world where they offer iQTS training

Contact the provider directly to:

* learn whether they work with, or will accept, a placement school in your region or country

* apply for a place on an iQTS training course

## Other routes to QTS

If you’re living in England and want a teaching qualification leading to QTS, you must [apply for teacher training in England](/steps-to-become-a-teacher).

If you’re already qualified as a teacher or have teaching experience, other routes to qualified teacher status (QTS) may be faster and more affordable.

Qualified teachers should check their eligibility to [apply for QTS in England](https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/eligibility/start).

If you have no teaching qualification but lots of experience, you should check your eligibility for [assessment only QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#apply-for-assessment-only-qts).

While induction is a requirement to teach in most schools in England, you do not need to complete an induction period to teach outside the UK. However, if you wish, you can choose to complete your early career teacher induction at a [Department for Education-accredited British School Overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-schools-overseas-inspection-reports/british-schools-overseas-accredited-schools-inspection-reports).
