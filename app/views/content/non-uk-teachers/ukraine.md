The [Department for Education (DfE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) supports and encourages Ukrainian trainees and teachers seeking teacher training places and jobs. 

We can help if you’re interested in teaching children aged 5 to 18. If you'd like to teach other age groups, try [teaching in a university](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-profiles/higher-education-lecturer) or [teaching in further education](https://www.teach-in-further-education.campaign.gov.uk/). 

## General information

If you're coming to the UK from Ukraine, [check what you need to do before you travel and what to do after you arrive](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/move-to-the-uk-if-youre-from-ukraine).

### Get an international relocation payment (IRP) worth up to $nonuk_internationalrelocationpayment_value$

If you're a teacher coming to England to teach languages or physics, you may be eligible for the IRP. [Learn more about the international relocation payment (IRP)](/non-uk-teachers/get-an-international-relocation-payment).


### Visas giving you the right to train to teach or teach in England

You already have the right to train or work as a teacher in England if you're in the UK on one of the following visas:

* [Ukraine Family Scheme visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa) – please note this scheme closed to new applicants on 19 February 2024
* [Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-visa-under-the-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme)
* [Ukraine Extension Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme) – please note this scheme closed to most new applicants on 16 May 2024 

You're also eligible to [apply for financial support if you choose to train to teach](#fees-and-financial-support).

If you’re not sure of the status of your visa, check:

* [Ukrainian nationals in the UK: visa support](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ukrainian-nationals-in-the-uk-visa-support)
* [UK visa support for Ukrainian nationals](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/support-for-family-members-of-british-nationals-in-ukraine-and-ukrainian-nationals-in-ukraine-and-the-uk)
* [Apply to stay in the UK under the Ukraine Extension Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme)

If you're already in the UK under a [different type of visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ukrainian-nationals-in-the-uk-visa-support) (for example, a visitor or seasonal worker visa) you can apply to the [Ukraine Extension Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme). 

### Staying in the UK long-term

If you're interested in working as a teacher and applying for [indefinite leave to remain in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain), you should consider a [Skilled Worker visa](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-teachers).   

Time spent in the UK under the Skilled Worker visa counts towards an application for permanent residence. You'll still need to meet the eligibility requirements for this type of visa.
You can apply for a Skilled Worker visa no matter what type of visa you currently have that allows you to stay in the UK. 

### Safeguarding and criminal records checks

Schools will assess your suitability to teach from a range of different sources, including:

* 2 references from previous employers
* your complete employment history
* evidence of your professional standing in Ukraine – for example, documentation from the [Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine](https://mon.gov.ua/ua) showing you are qualified and have no sanctions against you as a teacher
* a criminal record check

Teacher training providers will ask for:

* evidence you have a bachelor’s degree from a university (non-UK or in the UK)
* a criminal record check

You can [visit the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine website](https://vytiah.mvs.gov.ua/app/landing) to find out how to apply for a criminal record check, which will be emailed to you. You can then [contact the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK](https://uk.mfa.gov.ua/en) for a translation of the criminal record check and a letter confirming its validity.

### Your professional qualifications

You can find out more about [getting a statement of comparability from the UK ENIC](https://www.enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx) showing how your academic and professional qualifications compare to their English equivalent. However, you'll need scans or photographs of your original documents. 

## Train to teach in England

[Train to teach in England as a non-UK citizen](/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student) gives information about: 

* the qualifications you'll need to apply for teacher training 

* how to apply 

* help you can get with your application 

If you intend to apply for teacher training, you could consider [finding work as a teaching assistant](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-profiles/teaching-assistant) to gain experience until your teacher training course starts. 

### Fees and financial support

Ukrainian refugees in the UK under a Ukraine visa scheme have access to the same financial support as UK applicants. This means you'll:

* have the right to [apply for a student loan, bursary, scholarship](/funding-and-support) or [apply for an advanced learner loan](https://www.gov.uk/advanced-learner-loan) to help cover your fees and living expenses
* pay the same training fees as UK applicants (up to $fees_pgitt_domesticfulltime$ for a full-time course)

If you're not in the UK under one of these schemes, [find out about switching to a different type of visa](#visas-giving-you-the-right-to-train-to-teach-or-teach-in-england) so you can train to teach. Not all visas will give you the right to apply for a student loan. 

## Teach in England 

If you're already a qualified teacher, you do not need to retrain to get a job as a teacher in England. However, you'll need to:

* get English qualified teacher status (QTS), or be able to demonstrate strong non-UK qualifications and experience 
* pass criminal and professional safeguarding checks, including [completing an enhanced check from the Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service) (these will be organised by your employer)
* have a high standard of written and spoken English – for example, [having an English level B2 certification from the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages](https://www.efset.org/cefr/b2/) 

### English qualified teacher status (QTS)

[Teach in England if you trained outside the UK](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas) gives information about: 

* how teachers who qualified in Ukraine can apply for English QTS without further fees or training 

* finding a teaching job in England 

* life as a teacher in England 

### Meeting the standard for written and spoken English

If you’re in the UK under a Ukrainian visa scheme and aged 19 or over, you're eligible for funding to study an English for Speakers for Other Languages (ESOL) course (as well as other educational or training courses).

[Find your local authority (council)](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) and then search their website for ESOL courses. Or, search for courses using the [National Careers Service website](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/find-a-course/page?searchTerm=ESOL&distance=10%20miles&town=&orderByValue=Start%20date&startDate=Anytime&courseType=&courseHours=&courseStudyTime=&filterA=true&page=1&D=0&coordinates=&campaignCode=&qualificationLevels=). 
 
You can also learn English with a private provider. You can visit the websites of these English language courses for more information: 

* [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://www.ielts.org/)
* [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/toefl)
* [C2 Proficiency, formerly known as Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE)](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/proficiency/)

### Assessment only QTS
If you find you do not meet the eligibility criteria to apply for QTS, you could consider assessment only QTS. This means you can work in an English school and, alongside your job, apply to an English teacher training provider who will assess if you meet the standards for English QTS.

Check with [assessment only training providers](/train-to-be-a-teacher/assessment-only-route-to-qts) for more information about eligibility.

### Other ways to get teaching work and experience

Supply teachers provide teaching cover when schools are temporarily short of staff. Register with a supply teacher agency for short-term roles in school. [Find out more about being a supply teacher on the tes website](https://www.tes.com/jobs/careers-advice/supply-teaching/how-become-supply-teacher). 

[Find your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) and then search their website for teaching roles.

You could also consider [working as a teaching assistant](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-profiles/teaching-assistant) or in education support roles. It can be helpful to gain experience of the English education system before you apply for teaching jobs. [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/) lists these jobs. 

For a short-term unpaid placement, you can [get school experience in a primary or secondary school in England](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/). 

### Salaries and benefits

Your [salary as a teacher](/life-as-a-teacher/pay-and-benefits/teacher-pay) will depend on whether you have QTS, your level of experience, your school and your location.
