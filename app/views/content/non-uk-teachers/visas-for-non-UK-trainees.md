If you’re applying for teacher training as a non-UK citizen, you will need a visa or immigration status allowing you to study or work in England. The information on this page is for:

* non-UK citizens living in the UK
* non-UK citizens living outside the UK
* refugees or asylum seekers

You will not need a visa to train to teach in the UK if you:

* are an Irish citizen
* have [settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families)
* have [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk) 

If you are currently studying in the UK on a student visa, you may be able to apply for a [graduate visa](#other-types-of-visa-you-can-use-to-work-and-study-in-england).

### The EU Settlement Scheme 

If you or your family are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, and you or a family member were living in the UK by 31 December 2020, you may still be able to [apply to the EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families).

## Check your status

If you’re not sure about your immigration status, you can [check if you need a UK visa](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa
).

You can also [contact UK Visas and Immigration for help](https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk).

## Main visa routes for teacher training in England
 
Most non-UK applicants for teacher training will need one of the following:

* a student visa
* a skilled worker visa

### The student visa 

For a fee-paying teacher training course, you will need a student visa. Your visa must be sponsored by a teacher training provider that is a licensed sponsor of student visas.

Use [find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses) to search for providers who can sponsor student visas. We suggest you contact them to check they can sponsor you before you apply for a training place.

You’ll be able to apply for your visa if you:

* have a confirmed offer of a place on a course with a teacher training provider that is a licensed sponsor of student visas 
* have a reference number, called a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS), which your training provider will give you
* [have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money)
* [can speak, read, write, and understand English](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english)

For your teacher training place offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to pass criminal record and health checks, so we recommend applying to your training provider early.

* [you can speak, read, write, and understand English](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english)
* your salary meets the requirement for a skilled worker visa

### Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships

To apply for a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship you will need:

* settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme
* to have been living in the UK or the EEA for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship

If you do not have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you will need:

## Other types of visa you can use to work and study in England

### Graduate visa

If you are already an international student in the UK, you can [apply for a graduate visa on successful completion of your degree](https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa).

To apply, you will need to have been sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor over the course of your studies.

The graduate visa will allow you to study, work, or look for work in the UK for up to 2 years after completing your studies (3 years for PhD students) without a sponsor. 

This includes training as a teacher on a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course, if the course does not meet the requirements for a student visa. If the course can sponsor a student visa, you must apply for this type of visa.

You will be able to switch from a graduate visa to another visa (such as the skilled worker visa) without having to leave the UK, if you meet the requirements for the new visa route.

### High potential individual visa

[To be eligible for a high potential individual visa](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa), you must:

* have a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree or PhD from a university listed in the [Global Universities](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa/eligibility) list
* have been awarded your qualification no more than 5 years before you apply
* have English language skills to [B1 intermediate level](https://www.efset.org/cefr/b1/)
* have personal funds of £1,270
* pass a security and criminality check

You do not need an offer of a place on a teacher training course to apply for this visa and you’ll be able to stay in the UK for 2 years with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree, and 3 years with a PhD. 

If your visa application is successful, you will be able to train as a teacher on either a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course, as long as the course does not meet the requirements for a student visa. If the course can sponsor a student visa, you must apply for this type of visa.

### The Youth Mobility Scheme visa 

The [Youth Mobility Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility) allows [young people from certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility/eligibility) to come to the UK to study or work without a sponsor. This includes training as a teacher through either a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course.

A Youth Mobility Scheme visa lasts up to 2 years. You may be able to switch from a Youth Mobility Scheme visa to another visa route (for example, the skilled worker visa) without having to leave the UK. You’ll need to meet the requirements for the new visa route.

### Other visas 
Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work or study in the UK on alternative visas – for example:

* a [Family visa](https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa)
* a [UK Ancestry visa](https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa) 
* if you are from Hong Kong, a [British National (Overseas) visa](https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa)

### Refugees and asylum seekers 

If you have been granted refugee status, you can apply for teacher training – either salaried or fee-paying – and will usually be eligible for [financial support to train to teach on a fee-paying course](/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-UK-trainees).

If you are in the process of seeking asylum, you should refer to your immigration bail conditions to see if you have permission to study on a teacher training course. You will not usually be eligible for financial support to train to teach on a fee-paying course. You are also unlikely to be able to undertake salaried teacher training while your asylum claim is considered, because asylum seekers do not usually have the right to work, although [there are some exceptions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-whilst-an-asylum-claim-is-considered/working-in-the-uk-whilst-an-asylum-case-is-considered).

* [support for British and non-British nationals in Afghanistan](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/support-for-british-and-non-british-nationals-in-afghanistan)
* [support for Ukrainian nationals](/non-uk-teachers/ukraine)

## Visa fees and other charges

You will usually need to show proof of a certain level of savings or income, depending on which visa you are applying for. You’ll be guided through this process when you apply for your visa.

### Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)

You may need to [pay for UK healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application) as part of your immigration application – this is called the IHS.

However, students can usually claim a refund of the IHS if they:

* are a full-time student in UK higher education
* have a visa starting on or after 1 January 2021
* have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) issued in an EU country
* do not work in the UK

Learn more about [getting an IHS refund](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-health-surcharge-for-eu-students-in-the-uk).
