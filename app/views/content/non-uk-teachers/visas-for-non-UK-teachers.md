If you’re applying for teaching jobs in England as a non-UK citizen, you will need a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in England. 

The information on this page is for:

* non-UK citizens living in the UK
* non-UK citizens living outside the UK
* refugees or asylum seekers

### Teachers who will not need a visa

You will not need a visa if you:

* are an Irish citizen
* have [settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families)
* have [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk)

If you are currently studying in the UK on a student visa, you may be able to apply for a [graduate visa](#other-types-of-visa-you-can-use-to-work-as-a-teacher-in-england).

If you or your family are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, and you or a family member were living in the UK by 31 December 2020, you may still be able to [apply to the EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families).

## Check your status

If you’re not sure about your immigration status, you can [check if you need a UK visa](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa
).

You can also [contact UK Visas and Immigration for help](https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk).

## The skilled worker visa for teachers

The main visa route for non-UK citizens wishing to teach in England is the skilled worker visa.

You’ll be able to apply for your skilled worker visa if:

* you have a job offer from a school that is a Home Office licensed visa sponsor 
* [you can speak, read, write, and understand English](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english)
* your salary meets the requirements for a skilled worker visa

[Learn more about applying for a teaching job in England](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas)

### Salary requirement for a skilled worker visa

The salary you must be paid to get a visa depends on whether you have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#teachers-who-trained-outside-the-uk) and the region you are applying to work in.

The minimum salary non-UK teachers must be paid to be eligible for a skilled worker visa are as follows.

If you have QTS and work in:

* inner London, you must earn £32,157
* outer London, you must earn £29,915
* London fringe, you must earn £26,948
* rest of England, you must earn £25,714

If you do not have QTS and work in:

* inner London, you must earn £23,099
* outer London, you must earn £21,832
* London fringe, you must earn £19,613
* rest of England, you must earn £20,480

Check the region you will be working in with the school employing you. 

### Working part time as a teacher

You can work part time, but your salary must meet the threshold for a skilled worker visa. There are 2 requirements:

* your part-time salary must be at least £20,480
* the full-time equivalent of your salary must meet the minimum set for your region and status (QTS or non-QTS)

Schools have some flexibility in how they set salaries. You may be able to negotiate a different rate of pay if the salary on offer does not meet the skilled worker visa requirements.

The salary requirements for a skilled worker visa apply whether [the type of school you work in is funded by the UK government or is in the private sector](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school).

## Other types of visa you can use to work as a teacher in England

### Graduate visa

If you are already an international student in the UK, you can [apply for a graduate visa on successful completion of your degree](https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa).

To apply, you must have been sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor over the course of your studies.

The graduate visa will allow you to work or look for work in the UK for up to 2 years after completing your studies (3 years for PhD students) without a sponsor. This includes working as a teacher. 

You will be able to switch from a graduate visa to another visa (such as the skilled worker visa) without having to leave the UK, if you meet the requirements for the new visa route.

### High potential individual visa

[To be eligible for a high potential individual visa](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa), you must:

* have a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree or PhD from a university listed in the [Global Universities](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa/eligibility) list
* have been awarded your qualification no more than 5 years before you apply
* have English language skills to [B1 intermediate level](https://www.efset.org/cefr/b1/)
* have personal funds of £1,270
* pass a security and criminality check

You do not need an offer of a teaching job to apply for this visa and you’ll be able to stay in the UK for 2 years with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree, and 3 years with a PhD. 

### The Youth Mobility Scheme visa 

The [Youth Mobility Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility) allows [young people from certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility/eligibility) to come to the UK to work without a sponsor. This includes working as a teacher.

A Youth Mobility Scheme visa lasts up to 2 years. You may be able to switch from a Youth Mobility Scheme visa to another visa route (for example, the skilled worker visa) without having to leave the UK. You’ll need to meet the requirements for the new visa route.

### Other visas 
Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work in the UK on alternative visas – for example:

* a [Family visa](https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa)
* a [UK Ancestry visa](https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa) 
* if you are from Hong Kong, a [British National (Overseas) visa](https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa)
