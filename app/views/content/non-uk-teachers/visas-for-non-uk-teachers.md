## Applying for teaching jobs in England 

When searching for a teaching job, you will need to make sure: 

* the job offers visa sponsorship 

* the salary offered meets the requirement for a Skilled Worker visa 

$teachvacancies$

## Skilled Worker visa sponsorship

If you need a Skilled Worker visa to work in the UK, then you will need to apply for teaching jobs that offer visa sponsorship. This means you will be sponsored by an employer, such as the school where you will work and which has given you an official job offer.  

When you have a confirmed job offer, you will be able to [apply for a Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). 


### Salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa

When you apply for a job, you must make sure the salary offered meets the requirement for a Skilled Worker visa.  

The salary you need for a Skilled Worker visa will depend on whether you are employed as a qualified or unqualified teacher.  

To work as a qualified teacher in England, you need English qualified teacher status (QTS). If you do not have QTS, you will not be qualified to teach in some schools in England. The details of the job you are applying for will include whether the role is for teachers with QTS.  

The salary requirement varies depending on the area of England you are applying to work in.  

Schools have some flexibility in how they set salaries. You may be able to negotiate a different rate of pay if the salary offered does not meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements. 

$salaryrequirements$

### Working part time as a teacher

You can work part-time, but your salary must meet the threshold for a Skilled Worker visa. 

There are 2 requirements:

* your part-time salary must be at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisateacherminparttime$
* the full-time equivalent of your salary must meet the minimum set for your region and status for qualified and unqualified teachers

Schools have some flexibility in how they set salaries. You may be able to negotiate a different rate of pay if the salary on offer does not meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements.

## Dependants

Your partner and children can also apply to join you or stay in the UK as your dependants if they are eligible. Find out more about [how to apply to bring your partner and children with you on a Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/your-partner-and-children).
