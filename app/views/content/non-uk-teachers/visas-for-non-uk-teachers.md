## Applying for teaching jobs in England

* the job offers visa sponsorship 

* the salary offered meets the requirement for a Skilled Worker visa 

$teachvacancies$

## Skilled Worker visa sponsorship

If you need a Skilled Worker visa to work in the UK, then you will need to apply for teaching jobs that offer visa sponsorship. This means you will be sponsored by an employer, such as the school where you will work and which has given you an official job offer.  

When you have a confirmed job offer, you will be able to [apply for a Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). 


### Salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa

To be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa you must earn at least £25,000 or the [relevant minimum rate for teachers in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-pay-scales-for-eligible-teaching-and-education-jobs/national-pay-scales-for-eligible-teaching-and-education-leadership-occupation-codes), whichever is higher. You must earn at least £25,000 whether you are full or part-time.

The minimum rate of pay in England varies depending on the region, so check the region you will be working in with your teacher training provider. Schools also have some flexibility in how they set salaries. You may be able to negotiate a different rate of pay if the salary offered does not meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements.

## Dependants

Your partner and children can also apply to join you or stay in the UK as your dependants if they are eligible. Find out more about [how to apply to bring your partner and children with you on a Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/your-partner-and-children).
