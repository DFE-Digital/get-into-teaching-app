## How to apply for your visa

If you’re applying for teaching jobs in England as a non-UK citizen, you will need a [visa or immigration status allowing you to work in England](#check-your-status).

Most non-UK citizens who don't already have the correct visa or immigration status will need to apply for a Skilled Worker visa to teach in England. 

### To apply for your visa, follow these steps

#### Step 1 
Visit the UK government’s official [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/) service to search for teaching jobs in the UK. Filter your search by ‘visa sponsorship’ to find jobs that can sponsor visas. 

#### Step 2
Apply for a teaching job with a school which can sponsor your visa. Your salary must meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. 

[Learn more about applying for a teaching job in England](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas).

#### Step 3
When you have a confirmed offer of a job, you’ll be able to apply for your [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa).  

You will need to show: 

* you have a certificate of sponsorship from the school, confirming they have offered you a job and will sponsor you  
* [you meet certain standards in speaking, reading, writing and understanding English](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english)
* your salary meets the requirement for a Skilled Worker visa


### Salary requirement for a Skilled Worker visa
 
The salary you need to get a visa depends on if you're employed as a qualified or unqualified teacher.

The school you're applying to work in can explain if the role you're applying for is qualified or unqualified. Qualified roles require more experience or qualifications.

The salary requirement also varies depending on the region you're applying to work in. You can check which region you'll be working in with the school employing you.

If you're employed as a qualified teacher and work in:

* inner London, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisateacherminfulltime_innerlondon$
* outer London, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisateacherminfulltime_outerlondon$
* London fringe, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisateacherminfulltime_londonfringe$
* the rest of England, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisateacherminfulltime_restofengland$

If you're employed as an unqualified teacher and work in:

* inner London, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_innerlondon$
* outer London, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_outerlondon$
* London fringe, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_londonfringe$
* the rest of England, you must earn at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_restofengland$

### Working part time as a teacher

You can work part-time, but your salary must meet the threshold for a Skilled Worker visa. There are 2 requirements:

* your part-time salary must be at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisateacherminparttime$
* the full-time equivalent of your salary must meet the minimum set for your region and status (for qualified and unqualified teachers)

Schools have some flexibility in how they set salaries. You may be able to negotiate a different rate of pay if the salary on offer does not meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements.

### Your partner and children

You may be able to [bring your partner and children with you on a Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/your-partner-and-children).
