## Student visa for fee-paying training courses

Most teacher training courses in England are fee-paying. This means you will need to pay tuition fees to train.

You will need a Student visa if you’re on a fee-paying course. Your Student visa must be sponsored by your teacher training provider. 

Find out more about [studying in the UK on a Student visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa).

### Bursaries and scholarships if you are on a Student visa 

If you are training to teach physics or languages, you may be [eligible for a bursary or scholarship](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries).  

If you are going to get a bursary or scholarship, you can use this in your Student visa application as proof that you have enough money to support yourself. 

The first instalment of a bursary or scholarship is usually made by late October but you should confirm payment dates with your chosen provider.

## Skilled Worker visa for salaried training courses

Some teacher training courses in England are salaried. This means you [work and earn a salary while you train](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). 

You will need a Skilled Worker visa if you are on a salaried training course. Your Skilled Worker visa must be sponsored by the school employing you. 

Places on these courses are limited and some salaried courses also charge fees. 

Find out more about [working in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa).

### Salary requirement for a Skilled Worker visa 

You must earn a minimum salary to be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. This varies by region: 

* inner London: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_innerlondon$ 

* outer London: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_outerlondon$ 

* London fringe: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_londonfringe$ 

* rest of England: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_restofengland$ 

Check the region you will be working in with your teacher training provider. 

You may be able to train part-time, but your part-time salary must be at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminparttime$.


## What you need to do to apply for your visa 
You can apply for your visa once you have a confirmed offer of a training place.

$find$

Email your chosen provider to check if they can sponsor you. Once you have confirmation, you can then [apply for your teacher training course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training). 

### Dependants

You will not need to be sponsored for a Student or Skilled Worker visa if you have permission to live in the UK as a dependant of someone on a visa, usually a partner. You can work or study without a sponsor for the duration of your partner’s visa. 

You may be able to bring your partner and children with you if you are on a Skilled Worker visa. 


### Visa fees

You will need to pay visa fees. You can work out the cost of your UK visa application by [using the visa fees tool](https://www.gov.uk/visa-fees).  

When you apply for a visa, you will usually need to show you have enough money to support yourself in England by providing proof of savings or income.  

### Immigration Health Surcharge

You may need to [pay for UK healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application) as part of your immigration application. This is called the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS).

However, [some students can claim a refund of the IHS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-health-surcharge-for-eu-students-in-the-uk) depending on their circumstances.
