### Student visa 

Most teacher training courses in England are fee-paying. You'll need a Student visa if you train on a fee-paying course. Your Student visa must be sponsored by your teacher training provider. 

### Skilled Worker visa 

Some teacher training courses in England are salaried – this means you [work and earn a salary while you train](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). Currently, places on these courses are very limited. You'll need a Skilled Worker visa if you train on a salaried training course. Your Skilled Worker visa must be sponsored by the school employing you.
