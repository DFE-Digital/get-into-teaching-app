## How to apply for your visa

If you’re applying for teacher training as a non-UK citizen, you'll need a [visa or immigration status allowing you to study or work in England](#check-your-status). 

Most candidates who do not already have a visa or immigration status allowing them to study or work in England will need to apply for a Student or Skilled Worker visa.

### Student visa 

Most teacher training courses in England are fee-paying. You'll need a Student visa if you train on a fee-paying course. Your Student visa must be sponsored by your teacher training provider. 

### Skilled Worker visa 

Some teacher training courses in England are salaried – this means you [work and earn a salary while you train](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). Currently, places on these courses are very limited. You'll need a Skilled Worker visa if you train on a salaried training course. Your Skilled Worker visa must be sponsored by the school employing you.

### What you need to do to apply for your visa 

[Search for postgraduate teacher training](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) and filter your results by visa sponsorship. 

Email your chosen provider to check they can sponsor you, then [apply for your teacher training course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training). 

When you have a confirmed offer of a training place, you’ll be able to apply for your visa.  

To [apply for a Student visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa), you'll also need to: 

* have a reference number, called a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS), which your training provider will give you
* [have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money)
* [meet certain standards in speaking, reading, writing and understanding English](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english)

For a [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa), you'll also need to: 

* have a ‘certificate of sponsorship’ from the school which is paying you, confirming they will sponsor you 
* [meet certain standards in speaking, reading, writing and understanding English](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english)
* check your salary meets the requirement for a Skilled Worker visa 

### Salary requirement for a Skilled Worker visa 

Non-UK salaried trainee teachers must earn a minimum salary to be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa – this varies by region, as follows: 

* inner London: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_innerlondon$ 

* outer London: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_outerlondon$ 

* London fringe: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_londonfringe$ 

* rest of England: $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminfulltime_restofengland$ 

Check the region you'll be working in with your teacher training provider. 

You may be able to train part-time, but your part-time salary must be at least $nonuk_skilledworkervisatraineeminparttime$.

### Your partner and children 

If your course starts after 1 January 2024, you will not be able to bring your partner and children with you on a Student visa. 

You may be able to bring your partner and children with you on a Skilled Worker visa. 

### How a bursary or scholarship can help with your Student visa application 

If you're training to teach physics or languages, you may be [eligible for a bursary or scholarship](/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-uk-trainees?#bursaries-and-scholarships-for-non-uk-trainee-languages-and-physics-teachers). You can use them in your Student visa application as proof that you have enough money to support yourself.

## Visa fees and other charges

You'll usually need to show you have enough money to support yourself in England by providing proof of savings or income. You’ll be guided through this process when you apply for your visa.

### Visa fees

You’ll also have to pay [visa fees](https://www.gov.uk/visa-fees).

### Immigration Health Surcharge

You may need to [pay for UK healthcare](https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application) as part of your immigration application – this is called the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS).

However, some students can claim a refund of the IHS if they:

* are a full-time student in UK higher education
* have a visa starting on or after 1 January 2021
* have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) issued in an EU country
