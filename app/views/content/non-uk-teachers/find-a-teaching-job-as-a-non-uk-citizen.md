English qualified teacher status allows you to teach in any type of  schools in England.

Depending on your immigration status, you may have to [apply for a new visa](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-teachers) (usually a Skilled worker visa) to work as a teacher in the UK. 

## Apply for your teaching job  

To find a teaching job, you must apply to individual schools (not the Department for Education). If you need a Skilled Worker visa, you must find a school that can sponsor your visa. 

You can search for a teaching job through the government’s official [Teaching Vacancies service](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/). Filter your search by ‘Visa sponsorship’ to find jobs that can sponsor visas. Set up job alerts so you don’t miss out on new roles. 

Most teaching vacancies are advertised in March, April or the first half of May, with jobs usually starting at the beginning of the school year in September.  

Learn more at [Find a teaching role at the right school](https://teaching-vacancies.campaign.gov.uk/find-a-teaching-role-at-the-right-school/?). 

 
### Salaries and benefits 

Schools have some flexibility on [teachers’ salaries](/is-teaching-right-for-me/teacher-pay-and-benefits). It varies by region and your level of skill, experience and qualifications. 

There are [specific salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-teachers/#salary-requirement-for-a-skilled-worker-visa).

## Career progression 

In your first teaching job, you’ll complete an early career teacher (ECT) 2-year induction period, when you’ll work and be assessed as a paid teacher in a school. This induction period is part of the UK government’s [early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework) for teachers in England, which helps teachers succeed by developing their professional practice, knowledge and working habits. You’ll get training and support from a mentor to help you meet the Teachers’ Standards. 

You’ll also be able to develop your career through the [national professional qualifications framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-professional-qualifications-framework).
