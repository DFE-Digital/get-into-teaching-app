Are you a UK-trained teacher and UK citizen currently teaching abroad? Our
children and young people need your international skills, experience and
perspective.

If you're thinking about coming home to teach, we want to help.

If you are a non-UK citizen interested in teaching or training to teach in
England, please read our [guidance for international teachers](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas) or
[guidance for international trainees](/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student).
