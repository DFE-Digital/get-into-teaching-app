iQTS leads to the automatic award of [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) without further fees or training. QTS allows you to teach in all schools in England, as long as you have the correct immigration status or visa. In some schools you'll need to go through an [induction period](#complete-your-induction).

### Apply for your teaching job and visa

You can [apply for teaching jobs in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/) using a free, UK government-backed service.

You'll also need a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in England. You can use this UK government tool to [check if you need a visa](https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa). 

You will usually need to find a job before you apply for a visa. [Learn more about applying for the correct visa to teach in England.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk#visas-and-immigration)

### Complete your induction

As a newly qualified teacher, you’ll find some schools in England will require you to complete a 2-year induction period. During this time you’ll work and earn a salary as a teacher, and be assessed as part of the Department for Education’s [early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework). You’ll be expected to show you meet [English teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) and you’ll also benefit from training and mentoring. You’ll need to pass this induction to continue working in English schools.

### Induction for teachers working outside England

You do not need to complete an induction period if you want to work in schools outside the UK. However, if you wish, you can choose to complete your Early Career Framework induction at a [Department for Education-accredited British School Overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-schools-overseas-inspection-reports/british-schools-overseas-accredited-schools-inspection-reports).
