You will be able to study iQTS if your chosen training provider works with, or will accept, a placement school in your region.

### Responsibility for finding a placement school

Some iQTS training providers will have an existing relationship with a school in your region, and will be able to match you to that school.

Others will ask you to find your own local placement school as a condition of entry to their course.

Alternatively, if you are already working in a school, your training provider may accept this as a suitable placement.

Please check participating iQTS training provider websites for more details about their approach to placement schools, and whether these are available in your region.

### What you can expect from your iQTS training provider

Individual iQTS training providers will vary in their approach to delivering iQTS. However, all have been checked to ensure their training programmes comply with [iQTS criteria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-criteria-for-providers) and enable trainees to meet the [iQTS Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-teachers-standards).

In addition, all iQTS training providers offer:

* 1 academic year of training, including at least 120 days gaining practical experience in a placement school and further academic tuition delivered either online or in person

* teaching and assessment from highly experienced English teacher training staff at your chosen provider

* face-to-face mentoring at your placement school

* regular feedback and rigorous quality control

To learn more, visit participating iQTS training provider websites.

Over time, iQTS will become more widely available, with more training providers and more placement schools in regions around the world.
