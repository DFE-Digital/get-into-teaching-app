Citizens of every country in the world can apply to train to teach in England.

When you have successfully completed your training, you will be awarded English [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts), a professional qualification valued globally.

When you plan your training, bear in mind that:

- international candidates can expect to pay an average of about £15,000 to train, plus living costs
- depending on your immigration status and the subject you train to teach, you may get some financial support
- training lasts one academic year full-time, or longer part-time
- you can apply for paid teaching jobs as soon as you successfully complete your training and gain English qualified teacher status (QTS)
- you'll earn at least £30,000 a year (or more in London) when you qualify as a teacher 
- you may need to extend or switch your visa to live and work in the UK long-term
