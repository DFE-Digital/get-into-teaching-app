You can apply to train to teach in England if you:

* live outside the UK
* live in the UK but are a non-UK citizen

Before you apply, you must [check your eligibility to train to teach in England](/non-uk-teachers/non-uk-qualifications).  

If you are unsure about your qualifications or eligibility, you can [get help and support online or over the phone](/help-and-support). 

## Qualifying to teach in England

You will need [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) to teach in most schools in England.

If you do not want to come to England to study, you can [gain international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status) where you live or work, with no need to visit the UK. If you get iQTS, you automatically get QTS as well.  

If you are already a qualified teacher, find out how you can [teach in England if you completed your teacher training outside the UK](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas).

## Fees and financial support

### Fee-paying teacher training courses 

A [fee-paying teacher training course](/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-uk-trainees) means you pay tuition fees for your training. Tuition fees are set by providers and cost $fees_pgitt_internationalaverage$ on average per year. 

You may be able to get financial support for fee-paying courses, depending on your immigration status and the subject you train to teach.  

If you want to train to teach languages or physics, you could be [eligible for a bursary or scholarship](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) worth up to $scholarships_nonuk_max$. 

If you are not training to teach these subjects, any financial support you get will depend on [your immigration status or the visa you are on](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees).  

### Salaried teacher training courses 

A [salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training) means you are paid to work in a school while you train to teach. Some salaried courses also have tuition fees.  

Salaried teacher training courses are limited in number and very competitive. You will also need a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK.

## Apply for a postgraduate teacher training course
