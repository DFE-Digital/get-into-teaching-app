Citizens of every country in the world can apply to train to teach in England. 

You'll need [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) to teach in most schools in England.

If you do not want to come to England to study, you can [gain international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status) where you live or work, with no need to visit the UK. If you get iQTS, you automatically get QTS.  

If you're already a qualified teacher, find out how you can [teach in England if you completed your teacher training outside the UK](/non-uk-teachers/teach-in-england-if-you-trained-overseas).

## Check your eligibility and get support with qualifications

Before you apply, you must [check your eligibility to train to teach in England](/non-uk-teachers/non-uk-qualifications).  

To train to teach in England, you'll need qualifications equivalent to: 

* GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary) 

* a bachelor's degree in any subject 

If you’re unsure about your qualifications or eligibility, you can [get help and support online or over the phone](/help-and-support). 

## Find out about fees and financial support

Teacher training courses can be fee-paying or salaried. 

### Fee-paying teacher training courses 

A [fee-paying teacher training course](/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-uk-trainees) means you pay tuition fees for your training. Tuition fees are set by providers and cost $fees_pgitt_internationalaverage$ on average per year. 

You may be able to get financial support for fee-paying courses, depending on your immigration status and the subject you train to teach.  

If you want to train to teach languages or physics, you could be [eligible for a bursary or scholarship](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) worth up to $scholarships_nonuk_max$. 

If you’re not training to teach these subjects, any financial support you get will depend on your [immigration status or the visa you are on](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees).  

### Salaried teacher training courses 

A [salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training) means you’re paid to work in a school while you train to teach. Some salaried courses also have tuition fees.  

Salaried teacher training courses are limited in number and very competitive. You’ll also need a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK.  

## Find and apply for teacher training courses

You can [search for postgraduate teacher training courses](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) that lead to qualified teacher status (QTS).  

Postgraduate teacher training usually takes 9 months full-time, or 18 to 24 months part-time. 

[Find guidance on applying for teacher training courses](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-application). 

## Apply for your visa

If you do not have the right to study or work in the UK, you’ll need a visa. Your visa will need to be sponsored by a course provider.  

Before you apply for your visa, you must have a confirmed offer of a training place on a course offering Student or Skilled Worker visa sponsorship. Find out more about [applying for a visa to train to teach in England](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees).  


### Complete background checks

If you get offered a place on a course, your provider will arrange a background and criminal records check. This is known as a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.  

Due to rules about immigration, not all providers can accept international applicants – contact the providers before you apply to check.
