If you’re applying for teacher training as a non-UK citizen, the process is different to that for UK citizens. 

Read our tips and guidance to increase your chances of success. 

## Check you can afford to train to teach 

Fees are higher for non-UK citizens and you’re unlikely to get financial support. [Learn more about fees and any funding you may be eligible for.](/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-uk-trainees)  

## Get school experience 

Consider getting experience in a school. This will help you understand if teaching is right for you and give you an insight into teaching. You can also write about what you learn in your [personal statement](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-personal-statement?).  

If you’re in the UK, you can get help finding [unpaid work experience in schools](/is-teaching-right-for-me/get-school-experience?).  

If you’re outside the UK, you could contact local schools to ask about work experience opportunities.

## Apply for teacher training before you apply for your visa

Before you apply for your visa, you must have a confirmed offer of a training place from a provider who can sponsor visas. 

If you have settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families?) or [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk?), you can apply to any English teacher training provider. 

## Apply to train as early as you can 

For your teacher training place offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to pass criminal record checks, so we recommend applying early. You can apply for teacher training from October, for courses starting the following year in September or January. 

You can prepare by:  

* [applying for a criminal record check](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants) from the appropriate authority in your country 

* [getting your references ready](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-references)  

Once your training place is confirmed, you can apply for your visa up to 6 months before the start of your course.  

## Ways to train 

You can train in a school or in a university setting, and study full-time (over a year) or part-time (over 2 or more years).  

Teacher training courses can also be: 

* ‘fee-paying’ – you [pay a fee to study](/funding-and-support/tuition-fees) 

* ‘salaried’– you are [paid to work in a school while you study](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training) 

If you don’t have a bachelor’s degree, you can explore other routes into teacher training. 

## Choosing a subject to teach 

The subject you apply to teach must usually be the same as, or closely related to, the subject you studied at university. For example, engineering graduates can apply to train to teach physics, but computer science graduates are unlikely to be accepted to train to teach geography. 

A [subject knowledge enhancement course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement) can help. 

## Choosing an age group to teach 

Education in English is divided into: 

* [primary (ages 5 to 11)](/is-teaching-right-for-me/who-do-you-want-to-teach/#primary-ages-5-to-11) 

* [secondary (ages 11 to 18)](/is-teaching-right-for-me/who-do-you-want-to-teach/#secondary-ages-11-to-18) 

You can also teach children with [special educational needs](/is-teaching-right-for-me/teach-disabled-pupils-and-pupils-with-special-educational-needs). 

## Finding the right course for you  

[Find postgraduate teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses) lists courses leading to [English qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts). 

If you need a visa, remember to filter your search results by visa sponsorship. 

You can also search courses by: 

* location 

* teaching subject 

* age group 

* courses which pay a salary

### Do your research before you apply 

You can read up on:

* [teacher training personal statement](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/teacher-training-personal-statement)

Email your chosen provider to check they can sponsor you, then apply for your teacher training course. 


### Check your qualifications 

Make sure you have the right qualifications and apply for a [statement of comparability](/non-uk-teachers/non-uk-qualifications) proving your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK bachelor’s degree. 

 
### Research English education 

Even if you’ve never spent time in an English school, teacher training providers will want to know you’re familiar with: 

* [types of English school](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school) 

* [the English curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum)

* [English qualification levels](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels)

* [behaviour and discipline in schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-in-schools--2) 

* [Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted?)

You can learn more by: 

* visiting [The Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/guidance-for-teachers) – a charity gathering international evidence on teaching 5 to 16 year olds 

* visiting [Times Educational Supplement (TES)](https://www.tes.com/en-gb) – information and resources for teachers 

* [joining the Aspiring Teachers Forum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1357146377672255/)

* [reading interviews with real teachers](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/blog)
