[Qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools.

Schools in England where teachers can be employed without QTS include [academies](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies), [free schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools) and [private schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools).

However, even where QTS is not a legal requirement, many schools use QTS to assess the quality of candidates for teaching jobs.
[Find out about the different types of schools in England](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school).
If you completed your initial teacher training in England, you should already
have QTS. You can check this in the [Database of Qualified Teachers](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login).

If you have been working as an unqualified teacher overseas, and you have a degree, you may be able to
get QTS through the [assessment only (AO) route](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#AO) without any further training or the need to visit the UK.

You could also consider studying for [international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status). This new qualification is backed by the Department for Education and means you can train where you live and work, with no need to visit the UK.

If you trained as a teacher outside the UK, depending on where you qualified, you may be able to [apply to the Teaching Regulation Agency for QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#apply-to-the-teaching-regulation-agency-tra).

If you have fewer than 2 years' teaching experience, you will need to [apply
for a teacher training course leading to QTS in England](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses)
