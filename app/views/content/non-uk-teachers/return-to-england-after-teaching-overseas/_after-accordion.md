### What you can expect from the Department for Education (DfE)

#### Continuous professional development (CPD) and competitive teaching salaries

The Department for Education (DfE) can support your CPD through [national professional qualifications (NPQs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-list-of-providers)
for middle and senior leadership, headship and executive leadership.

[Salaries and benefits](/salaries-and-benefits) explains teaching salaries for newly qualified and more experienced teachers.

#### Workload, behaviour and flexible hours

We’re taking action to address some of the common issues that teachers face in the classroom and have collaborated with schools to:

* [develop a workload reduction kit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [invest £10m in behaviour hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs)
  so schools with exemplary pupil behaviour can help other schools improve
* increase [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools)
  for teachers

Teacher mental health is an important focus for DfE. Read our [Teaching blog](https://teaching.blog.gov.uk/) to
