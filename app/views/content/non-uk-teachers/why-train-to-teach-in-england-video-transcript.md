## Teach in England

**Describer:** The title "Teach in England" is displayed with the logo of HM Government (the UK Government) and the Teaching Every Lesson Shapes a Life logo. 

### Why train to teach in England?

**Describer:** Maths teacher Christobel Gondwe is sitting in a classroom with a globe and books displayed on the tables behind her. 

**Christobel:** "If you want a job that you will love and you will feel wanted, and you will be looked after in essence, and you want a job where you can develop and progress, I’d definitely say to consider teaching in the UK."

### Is it hard to get on to a teacher training course in England?

**Describer:** Trainee science teacher Nellie D’Costa is sitting in a science lab.

**Nellie:** "I assumed that it would be hard because I come from India. But then it was quite straightforward and easy."

**Describer:** Trainee modern foreign languages teacher Giorgio Tatananni is sitting in a classroom.

**Giorgio:** "Getting a training place here was so much easier than I thought."

### How about sorting your visa and documents?

**Christobel** "Sorting out my visa was a lot easier than expected. The information on the UK Border Agency’s website was very comprehensive, and my school and training provider were very knowledgeable, so I had people holding my hand from start to finish. It was very easy to do."

### What support did you get?

**Nellie:** "The support that I received when I applied for my training course was tremendous. I was supported at every step, right from the very beginning. Whenever I had a doubt, I would just call them up and they were more than happy to help me."

**Giorgio:** "They are very thorough in your preparation. They never overload you with information."

**Christobel:** "I felt that I had a lot of support. The application process was very straightforward. The process from start to finish was fantastic."

### Did the training meet your expectations?

**Giorgio:** "The teacher training did not meet my expectation, it exceeded my expectation, simply because of all the support you get and all the help you have from your advisers and mentors."

**Nellie:** "The training did meet my expectations and it was much more than I expected. It was really good because there are so many things that I didn’t know before, even though I was teaching, that I’ve learned here. So for me, it has been a fruitful experience."

### Anything else you’d like to tell us?

**Nellie:** "The value of gaining a transferable qualification through training to teach in England is that you can go anywhere in the world and you can teach, and you can go in that part of the world and you can make a difference, not just in the lives of the children but also in the people around you."
