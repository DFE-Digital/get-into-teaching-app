$funding-holding-message$

If you’re applying for teacher training as a non-UK citizen, you may be able to get some financial support from the UK government.

Your eligibility for support will depend on your [immigration status](#check-your-immigration-status-and-eligibility-for-financial-support) and choice of subject. Most non-UK citizens without some type of settled status in the UK will not be eligible, unless they train to teach languages or physics.

The information on this page is for:

* non-UK citizens living in the UK
* non-UK citizens living outside the UK
* Irish citizens
* refugees or asylum seekers

## Teacher training fees

As a non-UK candidate, you can expect to pay between £9,250 and about £32,000 to train to teach in England – fees vary between training providers. You’ll also have to cover your living costs.

Depending on your [immigration status](#check-your-immigration-status-and-eligibility-for-financial-support), you may get a reduction in your fees to the rate paid by UK applicants (set at a maximum of £9,250). If you are eligible, this fee will be the same for all courses offered by accredited training providers. Please note – most non-UK candidates will not be eligible for this type of financial support. 

You can apply for a [salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). On this type of course, you will not pay a fee, and you can earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive. 

[Find teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses). 

## Financial support for non-UK trainee languages and physics teachers

There are 3 types of financial support you can get if you’re interested in training to teach languages and physics:

* an international relocation payment worth £10,000 for languages and physics
* bursaries worth up to £27,000 for languages and physics
* scholarships worth up to £29,000 for French, German, Spanish and physics

If you are eligible, you can receive both an international relocation payment and a bursary or scholarship. You cannot receive both a bursary and a scholarship.

## Get an international relocation payment (IRP) worth £10,000

The IRP is designed to repay some of the relocation expenses of languages or physics teacher trainees moving to England. 

If you are eligible, you’ll receive a single payment of £10,000 from the Department for Education (DfE) around the end of your first term training in England. You will not have to pay this money back. You can only receive the IRP once.

[Apply for the international relocation payment](/non-uk-teachers/get-an-international-relocation-payment).

## Bursaries and scholarships for physics and languages

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free payments from the UK government that you do not have to pay back. Bear in mind that:

* you cannot be awarded both a bursary and a scholarship
* bursaries and scholarships are only available for courses where you pay a fee to study teacher training
* bursaries and scholarships in physics and languages are open to all non-UK trainees (even if you are not eligible for other types of financial support from the UK government)  

#### Bursaries for physics and languages

You do not need to apply for a bursary – it will automatically be awarded to you through your training provider if you are eligible.

You may get a:

* physics bursary of £27,000
* languages bursary of £25,000

To be eligible, you’ll need a place on a course training to teach languages or physics with an accredited teacher training provider in England, in the academic year 2023 to 2024.

You’ll also need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

Each bursary scheme will have their own individual terms and conditions – contact your chosen teacher training provider for more information.

The languages bursary covers all languages offered by accredited teacher training providers. If a course combines 2 subjects (for example, physics plus mathematics, or modern foreign languages plus English), the bursary subject must form at least 50% of the course content.

#### Scholarships for physics, French, German and Spanish

To get a scholarship, you’ll need to be a high-quality student and pass a tough selection process.

If you’re successful, your teacher training provider will pay the scholarship money directly into your bank account over a period of 10 months.

You may get a:

* physics scholarship of £29,000
* French, German or Spanish scholarship of £27,000

To apply for a scholarship, you’ll need a place on a course training to teach French, German, Spanish or physics with an accredited teacher training provider in England, in the academic year 2023 to 2024.

You’ll also need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:1 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

In exceptional circumstances, you may be offered a scholarship with a bachelor’s degree class 2:2, if you have significant relevant experience.
You can check if you’re eligible for a scholarship and apply by visiting:

* the [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/iop-teacher-training-scholarships#gref) (for a physics scholarship) 
* the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/education/he-science/opportunities/ltts) (for a French, German or Spanish scholarship)

## Other types of financial support

If you have the right [immigration status](#check-your-immigration-status-and-eligibility-for-financial-support), you could be eligible for the following types of financial help from the UK government.

Tuition fees and maintenance loans are only available for courses where you pay a fee to train to teach.

### Tuition fee loan
Your tuition fees are paid in full, with the money going directly to your teacher training provider. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you’ll only start your repayments when your income is over a certain amount – for the 2023 to 2024 financial year, this is £24,996 per year.

### Maintenance loan
Money is paid directly into your bank account to help with your living costs. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you’ll only start your repayments when your income is over a certain amount – for the 2023 to 2024 financial year, this is £24,996 per year.

### Home fee rate
If you meet the requirements for a tuition fee loan, or tuition fee loan and maintenance loan, you will be charged fees at the rate set for UK candidates (set at a maximum of £9,250 for a full-time course).

### Bursaries or scholarships 
Physics and languages bursaries and scholarships are open to all qualifying non-UK candidates, regardless of their immigration status.
However, other bursaries and scholarships are only available to candidates who meet the eligibility requirements for a tuition fee loan, or tuition fee and maintenance loan.

If you are awarded a bursary or scholarship, the money is paid directly into your bank account and you can use it as you wish. You do not have to pay this money back.

## Check your immigration status and eligibility for financial support

You are more likely to get financial support if you have some type of settled status in the UK – for example, through the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain). Without settled status, most non-UK candidates will not be eligible for financial support, unless they train to teach languages or physics. [Bursaries, scholarships and the international relocation payment are available for languages and physics](#financial-support-for-non-uk-trainee-languages-and-physics-teachers).

To be eligible for financial support, you must usually have settled status (for example, indefinite leave to remain) and have been living in the UK, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man throughout the 3 years immediately before the start of your course. Exceptions apply in some cases – for example if you have been recognised as a refugee.

### Refugees and asylum seekers

If you have been recognised as a refugee by the UK government, you, your spouse or civil partner and your children, are eligible for financial support for teacher training.

You will also need:

* to have been living in the UK since you were recognised as a refugee

If you are an asylum seeker you will not be eligible for financial support, but if you are recognised as a refugee after your course has started, you may be able to claim financial support to complete your studies.

Financial support can include:

* help with course fees (a tuition fee loan)

If, as a refugee, you are eligible for help with course fees, you may also be eligible for a bursary or scholarship.

### Extra financial support
If you have a disability, children or an adult dependant to care for, and you are eligible for a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan, you may be able to apply for extra help. You do not have to pay this money back.
