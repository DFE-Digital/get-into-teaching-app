The information on this page is for:

* non-UK citizens living in the UK
* non-UK citizens living outside the UK
* Irish citizens


Most non-UK citizens will not be eligible for financial support from the UK government to help with teacher training.  

Some support may be available if: 

* you train to teach languages or physics 

* you have some type of settled status in the UK – for example, through the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain)

* you're an Irish citizen

## Teacher training fees

Teacher training fees for non-UK candidates vary between training providers.

Fees:

* cost £36,000 at their most expensive
* average at £14,765 

You’ll also have to cover your living costs. 

Most non-UK candidates will not be eligible for financial support to help with fees.

## Financial support for Irish citizens or those with settled status 

Irish citizens or non-UK citizens who have settled status may be eligible for: 

* a reduction in fees to the ‘home fee rate’ paid by UK applicants (set at a maximum of £9,250) – if you’re eligible, this fee will be the same for all courses offered by training providers 

* student loans to help with tuition fees and living costs

* [bursaries and scholarships in the subjects offered to UK citizens](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) 

[How to apply for student loans, bursaries and scholarships](#how-to-apply-for-student-loans-bursaries-and-scholarships).


## Salaried teacher training courses  

Non-UK citizens can apply for a [salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). On this type of course, you will not pay a fee, and you can earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive. 

You will also need a [visa or immigration status](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees/#skilled-worker-visa) allowing you to work in the UK.

[Find teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses). 

## Financial support for non-UK trainee languages and physics teachers

There are 3 types of financial support you can get if you’re interested in training to teach languages or physics:

* an international relocation payment worth £10,000 for French, German, Spanish and physics
* bursaries worth up to £28,000 for languages and physics
* scholarships worth up to £30,000 for French, German, Spanish and physics

If you're eligible, you can receive both an international relocation payment and a bursary or scholarship. You cannot receive both a bursary and a scholarship.

## Get an international relocation payment (IRP) worth £10,000

The IRP is designed to repay some of the relocation expenses of French, German, Spanish or physics teacher trainees moving to England. 

If you're eligible, you’ll receive a single payment of £10,000 from the Department for Education (DfE) around the end of your first term training in England. You will not have to pay this money back. You can only receive the IRP once.

Please note that you will not be able to use eligibility for the international relocation payment in your [visa application](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees) as proof that you have enough money to support yourself. 

[Check your eligibility for the international relocation payment](/non-uk-teachers/get-an-international-relocation-payment).

## Bursaries and scholarships for physics and languages

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free payments from the UK government that you do not have to pay back. They are paid to you by your teacher training provider. 

If your training provider asks you to pay some or all of your teacher training fees in advance, you can sometimes use a bursary or scholarship to meet these costs. 

You should also be able to use eligibility for a bursary in your [visa application](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees) as proof that you have enough money to support yourself. 

You do not need to pay an agent or any other third party to access a bursary or scholarship. Any agency or person offering to help you access a bursary may be fraudulent. [Avoid and report internet scams and phishing](https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing).
