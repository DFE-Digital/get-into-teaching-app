The information on this page is for:

* non-UK citizens living in the UK
* non-UK citizens living outside the UK
* Irish citizens


Most non-UK citizens will not be eligible for financial support from the UK government to help with teacher training.

Some support may be available if:

* you train to teach languages or physics

* you have some type of settled status in the UK – for example, through the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain)

* you're an Irish citizen

## Teacher training fees

Teacher training fees for non-UK candidates vary between training providers.

Fees cost:

* an average of $fees_pgitt_internationalaverage$
* a maximum of about $fees_pgitt_internationalmaxfulltime$

Most non-UK candidates will not be eligible for financial support to help with fees.

You’ll also have to cover your living costs.

## Financial support for Irish citizens or those with settled status

Irish citizens or non-UK citizens who have settled status may be eligible for:

* a reduction in fees to the ‘home fee rate’ paid by UK applicants (set at a maximum of $fees_pgitt_domesticfulltime$) – if you’re eligible, this fee will be the same for all courses offered by training providers

* student loans to help with tuition fees and living costs

* [bursaries and scholarships in the subjects offered to UK citizens](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries)

[How to apply for student loans, bursaries and scholarships](#how-to-apply-for-student-loans-bursaries-and-scholarships).


## Salaried teacher training courses

Non-UK citizens can apply for a [salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). On this type of course, you will not pay a fee, and you can earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive.

You will also need a [visa or immigration status](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees#skilled-worker-visa) allowing you to work in the UK.

[Find teacher training courses](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/).

## Bursaries and scholarships for non-UK trainee languages and physics teachers

There are 2 types of financial support you can get if you’re interested in training to teach languages or physics:

* bursaries worth up to $bursaries_postgraduate_nonuk$ for languages and physics
* scholarships worth up to $scholarships_nonuk_max$ for French, German, Spanish and physics

You cannot receive both a bursary and a scholarship.

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free payments from the UK government that you do not have to pay back. They are paid to you by your teacher training provider.

If some, or all, of your training fees are due in advance, your training provider may let you use a bursary or scholarship to meet these costs. Contact them to check.

You should also be able to use eligibility for a bursary in your [visa application](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees) as proof that you have enough money to support yourself.

You do not need to pay an agent or any other third party to access a bursary or scholarship. Any agency or person offering to help you access a bursary may be fraudulent. [Avoid and report internet scams and phishing](https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing).

## How to apply for student loans, bursaries and scholarships

To start your application for student loans, you need to have chosen your teacher training course, but you do not need a confirmed place.

[Check your eligibility and apply to Student Finance England](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance) for:

* tuition fee loans
* maintenance loans to help with living costs
* extra help if you have a disability, children or an adult dependant

If you're eligible for student loans, you'll also usually be eligible:

* for a home fee rate

* for bursaries in the subjects offered to UK citizens

* to apply for scholarships

Talk to your training provider about the home fee rate, [bursaries and scholarships](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries).
