The information on this page is for:

* non-UK citizens living in the UK
* non-UK citizens living outside the UK
* Irish citizens


Most non-UK citizens will not be eligible for financial support from the UK government to help with teacher training.  

Some support may be available if: 

* you train to teach languages or physics 

* you have some type of settled status in the UK – for example, through the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain)

* you're an Irish citizen

## Teacher training fees

As a non-UK candidate, you can expect to pay between £9,250 and about £36,000 to train to teach in England – fees vary between training providers. You’ll also have to cover your living costs. Most non-UK candidates will not be eligible for financial support to help with fees.

However, if you're an Irish citizen or have settled status, you may get a reduction in your fees to the 'home fee rate' paid by UK applicants (set at a maximum of £9,250). If you're eligible, this fee will be the same for all courses offered by accredited training providers. You may also be eligible for [student loans](#student-loans).  

You can apply for a [salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training). On this type of course, you will not pay a fee, and you can earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive. 

[Find teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses). 

## Financial support for non-UK trainee languages and physics teachers

There are 3 types of financial support you can get if you’re interested in training to teach languages and physics:

* an international relocation payment worth £10,000 for French, German, Spanish and physics
* bursaries worth up to £28,000 for languages and physics
* scholarships worth up to £30,000 for French, German, Spanish and physics

If you're eligible, you can receive both an international relocation payment and a bursary or scholarship. You cannot receive both a bursary and a scholarship.

## Get an international relocation payment (IRP) worth £10,000

The IRP is designed to repay some of the relocation expenses of French, German, Spanish or physics teacher trainees moving to England. 

If you're eligible, you’ll receive a single payment of £10,000 from the Department for Education (DfE) around the end of your first term training in England. You will not have to pay this money back. You can only receive the IRP once.

Please note that you will not be able to use eligibility for the international relocation payment in your [visa application](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees) as proof that you have enough money to support yourself. 

[Check your eligibility for the international relocation payment](/non-uk-teachers/get-an-international-relocation-payment).

## Bursaries and scholarships for physics and languages

Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free payments from the UK government that you do not have to pay back. They are paid to you by your teacher training provider. If your training provider asks you to pay some or all of your teacher training fees in advance, you can sometimes use a bursary or scholarship to meet these costs. 

You should also be able to use eligibility for a bursary in your [visa application](/non-uk-teachers/visas-for-non-uk-trainees) as proof that you have enough money to support yourself. 

You do not need to pay an agent or any other third party to access a bursary or scholarship. Any agency or person offering to help you access a bursary may be fraudulent. [Avoid and report internet scams and phishing](https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing).

Bear in mind that:

* you cannot be awarded both a bursary and a scholarship
* bursaries and scholarships are only available for courses where you pay a fee to study teacher training
* bursaries and scholarships in physics and languages are open to all non-UK trainees (even if you're not eligible for other types of financial support from the UK government)  

#### Bursaries for physics and languages

You do not need to apply for a bursary – it will automatically be awarded to you through your training provider if you're eligible.

You may get a:

* physics bursary of £28,000
* languages bursary of £25,000

To be eligible, you’ll need a place on a course training to teach languages or physics with an accredited teacher training provider in England, in the academic year 2024 to 2025.

You’ll also need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

Each bursary scheme will have their own individual terms and conditions – contact your chosen teacher training provider for more information.

The languages bursary covers all languages offered by accredited teacher training providers. If a course combines 2 subjects (for example, physics plus mathematics, or modern foreign languages plus English), the bursary subject must form at least 50% of the course content.

#### Scholarships for physics, French, German and Spanish

To get a scholarship, you’ll need to be a high-quality student and pass a tough selection process.

If you’re successful, your teacher training provider will pay the scholarship money directly into your bank account over a period of 10 months.

You may get a:

* physics scholarship of £30,000
* French, German or Spanish scholarship of £27,000

To apply for a scholarship, you’ll need a place on a course training to teach French, German, Spanish or physics with an accredited teacher training provider in England, in the academic year 2024 to 2025.

You’ll also need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:1 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

In exceptional circumstances, you may be offered a scholarship with a bachelor’s degree class 2:2, if you have significant relevant experience.
You can check if you’re eligible for a scholarship and apply by visiting:

* the [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/iop-teacher-training-scholarships#gref) (for a physics scholarship) 
* the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/education/he-science/opportunities/ltts) (for a French, German or Spanish scholarship)

[Find teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses) in languages and physics.



## Student loans

Most non-UK candidates will not be eligible for student loans to cover fees and living expenses. If you're an Irish citizen or have some type of settled status in the UK – for example, through the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain), some financial help is available.  

[Check your eligibility for student loans](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies).

If you're eligible for student loans you may also be eligible for a [teacher training bursary](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries). 

## How to apply for student loans, bursaries and scholarships 

To start your application for student loans, you need to have chosen your teacher training course, but you do not need a confirmed place. 

[Apply to Student Finance England](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance) for:

* tuition fee loans
* maintenance loans
* extra help if you have a disability, children or an adult dependant

Talk to your training provider about:

* home fee rate
* a [bursary or scholarship](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries)
