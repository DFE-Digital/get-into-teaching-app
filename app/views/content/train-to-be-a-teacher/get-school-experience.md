You can visit schools to get unpaid experience in the classroom before you start your initial teacher training (ITT).

It can help you:

- decide if you want to train to be a teacher
- discover which setting you’d like to teach in (primary or secondary)
- build a relationship with a school you might want to work for later

## What to expect

Your experience will either be in a school or joining classes and meeting teachers online. Placements usually last one or 2 days, but some can last up to 3 weeks.

During your experience, you’ll get to do things like:

- observe lessons
- see how teachers manage a classroom
- find out how specific subjects are taught
- speak to teachers and interact with pupils
- learn more about teacher training - including the application and interview process

## Find school experience

You can search for and request [school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/) in England.

If you can’t find what you’re looking for, you can call a school directly. You can [find schools near you](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) and ask who to talk to about getting school experience.

They may ask you to have a DBS check before attending.

Use our Get school experience service to search for and request experience in England.

## Other ways to get experience of the classroom

### Teaching internships

A paid [teaching internship](/teaching-internship-providers) could help you to understand what it’s really like in the classroom if you’re currently doing an undergraduate degree and are interested in teaching:

- chemistry
- computing
- languages
- maths
- physics

You’ll get to experience a range of activities to help you get a feel for school life.

### Watch pre-recorded lessons

You can [observe teachers’ lessons](https://teachers.thenational.academy/lessons-for-itt) on the Oak National Academy website to help you get to know teaching better, before or alongside your ITT.
