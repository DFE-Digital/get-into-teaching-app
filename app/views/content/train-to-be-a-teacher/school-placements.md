School placements are an essential and exciting part of school-led or university-led postgraduate teacher training. They're a chance to:

* get experience in the classroom
* immerse yourself in your placement schools
* get to know your pupils and see their progress
* be part of a school community and learn from other teachers
* start your career as a teacher

## How long are placements?

School placements are designed to last for a minimum of 24 weeks. This time is spread across at least 2 schools. This is to give you a varied and thorough experience in the classroom. 

For example, in your first placement you might teach key stage 4, and in your second placement you might teach key stage 3 in a school for pupils with [special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/special-educational-needs).

You'll need experience of teaching in 2 schools to be awarded [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).

## Where will my placements take place?

Your training provider will usually select placement schools for you. They'll contact you and discuss your situation to help them select the most appropriate locations. They'll often take into consideration your course, subject, commute and other personal circumstances.

## What will I do on my placements?

Your school placements aim to give you enough experience to: 

* meet all the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)

* achieve [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts)

On your school placements, you'll get hands-on experience of what it's like to be a teacher. So, you’ll be spending a lot of time in the classroom learning how to teach lessons. Beyond the classroom, you can get involved in other aspects of school life, like school trips, school plays, parents' evenings and staff meetings.

During your placements you’ll get to see your pupils progress and get an insight into how rewarding teaching can be.

## What support will I get during my placements?

School placements can seem daunting, but there's lots of support available.

### Your skills from training

You’ll start your placements well equipped with a toolkit of theory and techniques that you'll learn in training. Placements are a chance to put your new skills into practice. Find out more about the [skills needed for teaching](/life-as-a-teacher/teaching-as-a-career/skills-to-teach).

### Mentors

In each placement school, you'll have a dedicated mentor. Mentors are expert professionals and role models, who will give you knowledge, support and feedback throughout your placement to help you learn. You'll get to spend at least 1.5 hours a week with your mentor. 

Mentors also receive training on how to develop teachers and what trainees need to know to complete their course.

### Tutors

While your mentor is specific to each placement school, your tutor provides consistent support from your training provider throughout your placements. They'll work with you and your mentors to make sure you have enough support and are making good progress towards your placement goals.

### School leadership and policies

Your school leadership team and colleagues will be there to support you. Your placement schools may also have documents and policies in place to support their teachers. For example, all schools will have a behaviour policy that explains what's expected of pupils and what will happen if they misbehave.

## Are placements paid?

For fee-funded postgraduate training, you can get financial support through student finance, or you may be eligible for bursaries or scholarships. This support is available for your whole training course, including school placements. 

For salaried teacher training, you’ll receive a salary throughout your teacher training, including placements. Because of this, your placement school may also be referred to as your ‘employing school’.
