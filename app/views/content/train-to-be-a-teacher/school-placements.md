School placements are an important and exciting part of fee-funded or salaried postgraduate teacher training. They're a chance to:

* get experience in the classroom
* immerse yourself in your placement schools
* get to know your pupils and colleagues
* start your career as a teacher

## How long are placements?

School placements last for a minimum of 24 weeks. This time is spread across at least 2 schools. This is to give you a varied and thorough experience in the classroom. For example, in your first placement you might teach key stage 4, and in your second placement you might teach key stage 3 in a school for pupils with [special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/special-educational-needs). 

## Where will my placements take place? 

Your training provider will select placement schools for you. They will contact you and discuss your situation to help them select a location that you can travel to. 

## What will I do on my placement?  

You school placement aims to give you enough experience to: 

* meet all the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)

* achieve [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) 

On your school placement, you'll get hands-on experience of what it's like to be a teacher. So, you’ll be spending a lot of time in the classroom learning how to teach lessons. Beyond the classroom, you can also get involved in other aspects of school life, like school trips, school plays, parents' evenings and staff meetings.  

Over your placement you’ll get to see your pupils progress and get an insight into how rewarding teaching can be.

## What support will I get during my placement? 

School placements can be daunting, but you'll have lots of support.

### Your skills from training
You’ll start your placements well equipped with a toolkit of theory and techniques that you'll learn in training. Placements are a chance to put that into practice.  

### Mentors

In each placement school, you'll have a dedicated mentor. Mentors are expert professionals and role models, who will give you knowledge, support and feedback throughout your placement to help you learn. Mentors also receive training on how to develop teachers and what trainees need to know to complete their course. 

### Tutors

While your mentor is specific to each placement school, your tutor is a consistent support from your training provider throughout your placements. g

### School leadership and policies
Your placement school may also have documents and policies in place to support their teachers. For example, all schools will have a behaviour policy that explains what's expected of pupils and what will happen if they misbehave.  

## Are placements paid? 

For fee-funded postgraduate training, you can get financial support through [student finance](/funding-and-support/tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans), or you may be eligible for [bursaries or scholarships](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries). This support is available for your whole training course, including school placements. 

For salaried teacher training, you’ll receive a salary throughout your teacher training, including placements. Because of this, your placement school may also be referred to as your ‘employing school’.
