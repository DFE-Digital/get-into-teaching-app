Your initial teacher training (ITT) will vary depending on your course provider and the qualifications you're working towards.

You'll spend most of your time in school placements with some time dedicated to theoretical learning. Your training is likely to include a combination of:

* unobserved and observed teaching 
* taught sessions
* seminars and workshops
* tasks and assignments
* engagement with academic or professional research

The theoretical part of your training might be delivered by a university or in a school. Some training courses will be all school-based, but this does not mean that you’ll spend all your time teaching. Get advice on [how to choose your teacher training course](/train-to-be-a-teacher/how-to-choose-your-teacher-training-course).

You’ll also have a mentor to support you in your school placements and learning. They can provide feedback and guidance.

There are full-time and part-time teacher training courses available. Most postgraduate courses start in September, with a small number of courses starting on other dates throughout the year.

## What you’ll learn in initial teacher training

What you’ll learn will depend on your course and the qualifications it offers. You'll train towards one of the following qualifications:

* [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts)
* QTS with a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-a-pgce)

Initial teacher training helps you meet the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards). You must meet the teachers’ standards to be awarded QTS.

All initial teacher training courses cover [teaching pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND)](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/special-educational-needs). Once you've gained QTS, you can then train to specialise in working with children with SEND. 

All initial teacher training will help you:

* set high expectations which inspire, motivate and challenge pupils
* promote good progress and outcomes by pupils
* develop good subject and curriculum knowledge
* plan and teach well structured lessons
* adapt teaching to respond to the strengths and needs of all pupils
* make accurate and productive use of assessment
* manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning
environment
* make a positive contribution to your school community

## Your school placements

School placements enable you to get experience in the classroom. They're an essential and exciting part of your training, and help you learn the skills you need to be a teacher.

## Your teacher training timetable

Full-time teacher training usually takes 9 months, in line with the academic year. Part-time teacher training can take 18 to 24 months.

Some courses begin with time spent in a university or school where you start your theoretical learning. Your course pattern will be different depending on your training provider.

## How you’ll be assessed 

There are two types of assessments you’ll have as part of your training - formative and summative. Formative assessments are less formal and happen throughout your course. Summative assessments are formal assessments, usually at the end of your course.

You might be assessed through written assignments, lesson observations, or by a portfolio of evidence showing how you’re meeting the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards). Assessments vary by provider and the qualifications you’re working towards.

## Adjustments and accessibility

Providers can make adjustments if you need support because you're neurodiverse, have a long-term physical or mental health condition, or have any other accessibility needs.
