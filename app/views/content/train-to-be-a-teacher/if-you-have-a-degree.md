You need [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/what-is-qts) to teach in most primary, secondary and special schools in England. Once you have a degree you can get QTS through [teacher training](/train-to-be-a-teacher/initial-teacher-training). 

Postgraduate teacher training courses usually take 9 months full time, in line with the academic year, or 18 to 24 months part time. 

If you’re not from the UK, find out about [training to teach in England](/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student).

## Types of teacher training

Your teacher training course might be led by a university, school, college or group of schools. There are different teacher training types, including:

* school centred initial teacher training (SCITT)
* university-led
* postgraduate apprenticeship
* School Direct (fee-paying)
* School Direct (salaried)

The difference between teacher training courses will depend on your teacher training provider, rather than what type of teacher training you do.

All teacher training courses follow the same [core content framework (CCF)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework). You’ll spend most of your time in school placements with some theoretical learning, regardless of which type of training you choose.

## Choose your teacher training provider 

One of the best ways to decide between providers is to contact them.

Ask them what a typical day looks like, how you’ll be supported, and if they have any open days or [teacher training events](/events) you can attend.

### Find out where you’ll spend your time

Think about where you'd like to do your training. You should talk to teacher training providers about where your school placements and theoretical learning will be.

The address of your teacher training provider may not be where you spend most of your time. For example, your teacher training provider might be a university, but you’ll spend most of your time in placement schools.

## Decide if you want a PGCE or PGDE

All primary and secondary postgraduate teacher training courses lead to QTS. Some also offer a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) or a postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE)](/what-is-a-pgce).

You do not need a PGCE or PGDE to become a teacher. 

It can be helpful to have a PGCE or PGDE if you plan on doing a master’s degree because it gives you credits towards one. 

## Fund your training

Courses usually cost £9,250 or more for [international candidates](/non-uk-teachers). 

If you train to teach certain secondary subjects, you may be eligible for a [scholarship or bursary](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships).

No matter what course you choose, you can apply for a student loan.

[Learn about funding](/funding-your-training).

## Check your eligibility 

Your degree grade can affect your eligibility for courses. Teacher training providers often ask for a 2:2, but some ask for a third or pass.

If you need help understanding degree grades, [chat to us online](/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-have-a-degree#talk-to-us). 

### Find out if you're eligible for a salary  

Salaried courses are sometimes available for specific candidates, such as if you're working as an unqualified teacher. These include School Direct (salaried) courses and postgraduate teaching apprenticeships.

These are in high demand and very competitive. Places fill up quickly. 

You should check your eligibility with the teacher training provider before you apply. 

You could also consider [Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/) to earn a salary while you train.
