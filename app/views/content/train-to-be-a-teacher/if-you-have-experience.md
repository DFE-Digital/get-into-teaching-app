If you have been working in a classroom and you already have a degree, you may be able to get [qualified teacher status](/what-is-qts) (QTS) through a 12-week ‘assessment only’ programme.

You’ll need to show that you already meet the standards for QTS. For example, you may meet the standards if:

- you’ve already been employed as an unqualified teacher or teaching assistant for a significant amount of time (for example, 2 years) and you’ve worked in more than one school
- you’re a [qualified teacher who trained overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk)

Entry criteria may vary by teacher training provider. You should ask them about eligibility before you apply.

We have information for people who already have QTS and would like to [return to teaching](/returning-to-teaching).
