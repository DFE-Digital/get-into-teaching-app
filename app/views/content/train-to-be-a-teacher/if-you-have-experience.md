If you have been working in a classroom for a significant amount of time, as a teaching assistant or in a similar role, you may be able to get [qualified teacher status](/what-is-qts) (QTS) through a 12-week ‘assessment only’ programme. You  must also have a degree.

You’ll need to show that you already meet the standards for QTS. For example, you may meet the standards if:

- you’ve already been employed as an unqualified teacher or teaching assistant for a significant amount of time (for example, 2 years) and you’ve worked in more than one school
- you’re a [qualified teacher who trained overseas](/non-uk-teachers/come-to-england-to-teach-if-you-are-a-teacher-from-outside-the-uk)

Entry criteria may vary by teacher training provider. You should ask them about eligibility before you apply and make sure that you qualify.

If you already have QTS, find out how you can [return to teaching](/returning-to-teaching).
