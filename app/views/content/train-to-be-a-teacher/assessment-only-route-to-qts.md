If youâ€™ve worked as an unqualified teacher, you may be able to get [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) through an assessment only programme.

If you already have QTS, find out how you can [return to teaching](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/jobseeker-guides/return-to-teaching-in-england/return-to-teaching/).

## What is the assessment only route to QTS?

You can take the assessment only route to QTS if you already meet the standards for qualified teacher status, so do not need any further training.

Instead, you will undertake a series of assessments. This may include lesson observations, providing a portfolio of evidence to show you meet the teachersâ€™ standards, or written assessments. This will vary by your provider.

The assessment programme takes up to 12 weeks.

## How much does assessment only QTS cost?

Fees range from about $fees_assessmentonly_low$ to $fees_assessmentonly_high$, but vary between provider so itâ€™s best to check with them for more information.

Fees may be paid by you or your school at the start of the programme. If youâ€™re currently working in a school, talk to your employer about your funding options.

## Eligibility for assessment only QTS

To be eligible, you need (all of the following):

* to be able to show you meet the [teachers' standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) without any more training
* to have worked in 2 or more schools
* a degree
* GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary)

Specific entry criteria may vary by teacher training provider. You should ask them about eligibility before you apply.

### If you're a teaching assistant

If you've worked as a teaching assistant, it's unlikely you'll have the experience required for assessment only.

There may be exceptional cases where teaching assistants have worked for a significant amount of time (at least 2 years) independently teaching classes and may be eligible.

Talk to your provider about whether your experience makes you eligible for this route.

Or, find other ways you can [train to be a teacher](/train-to-be-a-teacher).

### If you live outside the UK or are a non-UK citizen

If youâ€™re based outside the UK, you will need to contact a [non-UK assessment only provider](/train-to-be-a-teacher/assessment-only-route-to-qts#group--outside-of-the-uk). You may also be interested in [international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status). With iQTS, you can train where you live and work, with no need to visit the UK.

If youâ€™re a non-UK citizen based in the UK, contact one of the regional or national providers listed on this page.
