A postgraduate teaching apprenticeship (PGTA) is a teacher training route that leads to [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts). You need QTS to teach in most primary, secondary and special schools in England. 

PGTAs are available for both primary and secondary stages, and cover a range of subjects and specialisms. 

## Who’s eligible for a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship? 

You need to have a bachelor’s degree to be eligible for a PGTA. If you do not have one, you can explore [how to become a teacher if you do not have a degree](/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-dont-have-a-degree).  

As a [salaried teacher training route](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training), PGTAs are very competitive. Some providers may want you to have significant teaching or school experience, for example, if you’re already working as an unqualified teacher or teaching assistant.

## How does a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship work? 

Like other types of initial teacher training (ITT), PGTAs combine on-the-job training with theoretical learning. On a PGTA, you’ll usually be teaching in school for 4 days a week, with one day off to attend training with your ITT provider.

Postgraduate teaching apprentices must do an end point assessment. This is usually done after you’ve completed your training and been awarded QTS. To complete the apprenticeship, you’ll need to pass your end point assessment and show you’ve met the apprenticeship standards.

You do not have to pay any training fees for a PGTA, as these are covered as part of the apprenticeship. You’ll also receive a salary throughout your apprenticeship.

## What’s the salary of a postgraduate teaching apprentice?

Postgraduate teaching apprentices are normally paid an [unqualified teacher’s salary](/life-as-a-teacher/pay-and-benefits/teacher-pay). The exact amount will vary depending on the school you work in. 

### Explore bursaries and scholarships on other teacher training routes

It’s worth checking if there’s a [bursary or scholarship](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) for a fee-paying route available before you apply for a PGTA. These can be worth up to $scholarships_generic_maxshortened$, depending on the subject.  

If you do a PGTA, you will not be eligible for a bursary, scholarship or student finance. You’ll also be taxed on your income, whereas you will not be taxed on a bursary or scholarship. 

If you’re eligible for a bursary or scholarship, you could receive more money on a fee-paying course than on a salaried training route like the PGTA.

## Applying for a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship

It’s usually wise to apply for fee-paying courses as well PGTAs to increase your chances of getting a teacher training place.
