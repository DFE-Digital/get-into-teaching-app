Your personal statement is your chance to make yourself memorable with teacher training providers and show them why you'll make a great teacher.

It's an important part of your application that can determine whether you'll be accepted onto a course.

You do not have to write it all at once – you can start it and come back to it. Successful candidates often take a few weeks to write their personal statements.

## How long should my teacher training personal statement be? 

Your personal statement should be between 500 and 1000 words. You could include: 

* skills you have that are relevant to teaching 
* any experience of working with young people 
* your understanding of why teaching is important 
* your reasons for wanting to train to be a teacher 
* any activities you’ve done that could be relevant to teaching (such as first aid courses, sports coaching or volunteering) 

Teacher training providers want to see your passion and that you understand the bigger picture of teaching.

Make sure you check your spelling and grammar in your application. You want to make the best possible impression.

<h3>If you’ve already started to apply</h3>

<p>You will see 2 sections for your personal statement with information on how to complete each section.</p>

<p>If your application is unsuccessful this time and you apply again, the 2 sections of your personal statement will merge. When this happens, you will be asked to review your statement before applying again.</p>

## Should my personal statement be different if I’m training to teach primary or secondary? 

You should use your personal statement to explain why you feel passionate about teaching a specific age range or subject. 

If you’re applying for a primary course with a subject specialism, or you’re particularly interested in certain primary subjects, you can talk about that, too. 

If you’re not sure if you want to teach primary or secondary, you can [find out more about teaching different age groups](/train-to-be-a-teacher/who-do-you-want-to-teach). 

You’ll have to decide who you want to teach before you write your application, as you’ll send the same personal statement to each course. This means it would be difficult to apply for one course teaching history, and another course teaching primary, for example. 

## Do I need school experience? 

You do not need school experience to apply for teacher training, but it can help strengthen your personal statement. 

Teacher training providers like to see that you have a good understanding of teaching, how the school system works and what your transferable skills are. You need more than just good subject knowledge and school experience can be a great way to get this. 

Getting some school experience can also be a good way to make sure teaching is right for you before you apply for a course.

## Get help with your personal statement 

You can get help with your personal statement from our [teacher training advisers](/teacher-training-advisers). They have years of teaching experience and can give you free, one-to-one support by phone, text, or email. 

Advisers can also help you understand more about what teaching is really like, which can help improve your application.
