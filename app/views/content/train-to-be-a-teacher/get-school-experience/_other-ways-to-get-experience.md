## Other ways to get experience of the classroom

### Watch pre-recorded lessons

You can [observe teachers’ lessons](https://teachers.thenational.academy/lessons-for-itt) on the Oak National Academy website to help you get to know teaching better, before or alongside your ITT.

### Teaching internships

You could apply for a [paid teaching internship](/teaching-internship-providers) if you’re currently doing an undergraduate degree and are interested in teaching:

- maths
- physics
- computing
- modern languages
