You can visit schools to get unpaid experience in the classroom before you start your initial teacher training (ITT).

It can help you:

- decide if you want to train to be a teacher
- discover which setting youâ€™d like to teach in (primary or secondary)
- build a relationship with a school you might want to work for later
