Give yourself the best chance of getting on the course you want.

Discover tips on completing your application, including writing your teacher training personal statement, choosing your references and preparing for interviews.

## Browse courses

Search [postgraduate teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

Course providers will help you gain your [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/what-is-qts) which is what you need to teach in most schools in England. Many also help you work 
towards a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) or postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE)](/what-is-a-pgce).

As part of selecting your teacher training course, you will need to decide if you want to train to teach at a primary or secondary level. [Learn about deciding who to teach](/train-to-be-a-teacher/who-do-you-want-to-teach).

## Where to apply

When you're ready, you can [apply for teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training).

This service has replaced the UCAS postgraduate teacher training application.

## When to apply

Courses usually open for applications in October for entry the following year
(usually starting in September, but sometimes January).

Teacher training providers allocate places as people apply through the year,
and courses stay open until they are full.

If you’re keen to join a popular course it’s wise to apply as soon as you’re
ready rather than putting it off.

## What to expect: the application form

When you apply you’ll need to give details about:

* your qualifications, including your GCSEs and A levels (or equivalents) and degree
* your work history or unpaid experience
* why you want to teach
* why you’re suited to teach a particular subject or age group

You can also share whether you need any adjustments during the application
process or on the course - for example, [if you’re disabled](/funding-and-support/if-youre-disabled).

You’ll be encouraged to declare any potential safeguarding issues such as
criminal convictions. Training providers can advise you whether it’ll affect
your application.

## Prepare your application

You can [find and apply to most postgraduate teacher training courses on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

You can choose up to 4 teacher training courses for each application.

If you do not find what you were looking for, there are [other ways to train](/train-to-be-a-teacher).

Before you start, it’s particularly important to think about your teacher training personal statement. Some people do not get on the course they want because their application has
not convinced the admissions team that they’re right for it.

## Writing your personal statement

Your personal statement explains why you want to be a teacher. It’s a crucial part of your application so it’s worth taking your time on it.

It’s your chance to show your motivation, commitment and teaching potential. It should be between 500 and 1000 words. You could include:

* skills you have that are relevant to teaching
* any experience of working with young people
* your understanding of why teaching is important
* your reasons for wanting to train to be a teacher
* any activities you’ve done that could be relevant to teaching like first aid courses, sports coaching or volunteering

Your personal statement is also the place to say why you feel passionate about teaching either primary or secondary. [Learn more about deciding who to teach](/train-to-be-a-teacher/who-do-you-want-to-teach).

If you’re writing a personal statement for secondary teacher training, you should also explain your interest in the subject you want to teach.

If you’re applying for a primary course with a subject specialism, or you’re particularly interested in certain primary subjects, you can talk about that, too.

<div class="inset">
<h4> If you have already started to apply </h4>

<p>You will see 2 sections for your personal statement with information on how to complete each section. </p> 

<p> If your application is unsuccessful this time and you apply again, the 2 sections of your personal statement will be merged. When this happens, you will be asked to review your statement before applying again.</p> 

</div>

### Get help with your personal statement

You can get help with your personal statement from our [teacher training advisers](/teacher-training-advisers). They have years of teaching experience and can give you free, one-to-one support.

## Choose your references

You need to provide the details of 2 people who can give you a reference when you apply. They will not be contacted until you accept a place on a course.

Unlike a standard work reference, your references for teacher training need to
be from named individuals rather than (for example) a human resources team or
academic department.

They'll confirm how they know you and if they know any reason why you should not work with children.

You'll need different kinds of references depending on your circumstances. If you:

* are still studying or graduated in the last 5 years, you'll need an academic reference
* already work in a school, you'll need a reference from your headteacher

You can give a character reference, such as from a mentor or someone you know through volunteering, as a second reference.

You should not ask a family member, partner or friend for a reference.

You can change your reference details when you accept a place on a course. You might need to alter their contact details if they've changed, or you may wish to change who you ask for a reference altogether.

## If you’re invited to interview

Interviews usually last a day and may include time spent teaching pupils.

Interviews vary from provider to provider – you’ll be given all the information
you need when you’re invited to attend.

## If you get an offer

Congratulations!

Before you start your training the provider will check whether you’re safe to work
with children through an enhanced [DBS check](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

They’ll also check whether you’re fit to train to teach through a health questionnaire.

If you’re missing certain qualifications they may also ask you to do an
equivalence test or take a ‘subject knowledge enhancement’ course.

## If you do not get a place

Try not to worry. There could be a few reasons your application was unsuccessful.

You may need to get an additional qualification, improve your interview
technique or improve the quality of your application.
