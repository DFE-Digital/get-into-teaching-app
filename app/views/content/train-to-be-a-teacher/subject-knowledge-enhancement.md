If you’re concerned about how well you know the subject you want to teach, do not worry - you may be able to do a ‘subject knowledge enhancement’ (SKE) course.

SKE courses can help when you have:

- a different but related degree to the subject you want to teach
- an A level but not a degree in the subject
- an unrelated degree but relevant professional experience
- studied for a languages degree, but need to develop a second language to an acceptable level for teaching in schools
- not used your subject knowledge for a while

When you apply for teacher training, the school or university will help you establish whether you need to improve your subject knowledge. They may decide to make completing a SKE course a condition of your offer to train with them.

SKE courses are currently offered in 9 secondary subjects:  

- mathematics (including primary mathematics) 
- English 
- physics 
- chemistry 
- biology 
- computing 
- languages 
- design and technology  
- religious education

SKE course lengths can range from 8 to 28 weeks and are usually online courses, but some are classroom based and some, a mixture of both. You can choose the provider you wish to complete your SKE course with. 

Courses are available across England. Most candidates complete a SKE course before starting their teacher training year, but it’s sometimes possible to complete it alongside your ITT course. You may also be able to study part-time.

You may also be eligible to receive the SKE participant bursary, contact your ITT and SKE provider for more information. For academic year 2022/23, the participant bursary funding is £175 per week.
