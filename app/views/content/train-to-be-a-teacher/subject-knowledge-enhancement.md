If you’re concerned about how well you know the subject you want to teach, do not worry - you may be able to do a ‘subject knowledge enhancement’ (SKE) course.

SKE courses can help when you have:

- a different but related degree to the subject you want to teach
- an A level but not a degree in the subject
- an unrelated degree but relevant professional experience
- studied for a languages degree, but need to develop a second language to an acceptable level for teaching in schools 
- not used your subject knowledge for a while

When you apply for teacher training, the teacher training provider will help you establish whether you need to improve your subject knowledge. They may decide to make completing a SKE course a condition of your offer to train with them.

SKE courses are currently offered in 9 secondary subjects:  

- biology 
- chemistry 
- computing 
- design and technology 
- English
- languages 
- mathematics
- physics 
- religious education

You can also do a SKE course in primary mathematics.

SKE course lengths can range from 8 to 28 weeks. They're usually online, but some can be classroom based and some can be a mixture of both. You can choose the provider you want to complete your SKE course with.

Courses are available across England. Most candidates complete a SKE course before starting their teacher training year, but it’s sometimes possible to complete it alongside your initial teacher training (ITT) course. You may be able to complete the SKE course on a part-time basis.

You may also be eligible for a bursary of £175 per week if you train to teach in the 2022/23 academic year. This will go towards any extra costs you may have during the SKE course. Contact your ITT and SKE providers for more information.
