If you’re concerned about how well you know the subject you want to teach, do not worry - you may be able to do a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course.

SKE courses can help when you have:

* finished your degree more than 5 years ago
* a different but related degree to the subject you want to teach
* an A level but not a degree in the subject you want to teach
* an unrelated degree but relevant professional experience
* studied for a languages degree, but need to develop a second language to an acceptable level for teaching in schools

## How to do a SKE course

When you apply for teacher training in England, talk to your training provider if you think you need to improve your subject knowledge. They’ll help you decide if you need to complete a SKE course, and may make it a condition of their offer to train with them.

You’ll choose your SKE course provider, but your teacher training provider can help you decide on the right one for you.

### SKE course subjects

SKE courses are currently available in 9 secondary subjects:

* biology
* chemistry
* computing
* design and technology
* English
* languages
* mathematics
* physics
* religious education

You can also do one in primary mathematics.

## How do SKE courses work?

SKE courses are usually online, but some can be classroom based and some can be a mixture of both. 

Course lengths range from 8 to 28 weeks and are usually 25 hours per week. Your course length will be determined by your provider, based on your gap in knowledge. Different providers may offer different course lengths.

You can also do a part-time SKE course and complete it over a longer period, or sometimes shorter. Your SKE provider will be able to discuss your options with you.

### When you should complete your course

You should complete your SKE course before starting your teacher training. If you run out of time, your provider may allow you to continue your SKE course whilst starting your teacher training, but you will not be paid the SKE course bursary for these weeks.

## Get a SKE bursary

If you train to teach in the 2022/23 academic year, you could be eligible for a bursary of £175 per week. If you do a part-time SKE course and complete less than 25 hours of your SKE course a week, this will be pro rata. How and when your bursary will be paid will vary by your training provider.

You can use your SKE bursary for any extra costs you may have during your SKE course, for example, making up for any lost income.

### Eligibility for a SKE bursary

You’ll need (one of the following):

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 or above 
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If you’re a non-UK citizen, you’ll only be eligible for a SKE bursary if you’re training to teach physics or modern foreign languages.
