If you have a bachelor's degree and are interested in gaining a qualification in education, you may want to do a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).

You can get a postgraduate certificate in education through teacher training. A PGCE can help you develop your [teaching skills and knowledge](/life-as-a-teacher/teaching-as-a-career/skills-to-teach).

You do not need a PGCE to be a qualified teacher in England.

## The qualifications you need to teach in England

You need qualified teacher status (QTS) to teach in most primary, secondary and special schools in England. You can get QTS through undergraduate or postgraduate teacher training.

$qts$

Many teacher training courses also offer a postgraduate qualification, such as a PGCE, but you do not need one to teach.

## Teacher training courses

You can do a teacher training course that leads to:

* QTS only
* QTS with PGCE
* PGCE without QTS

Getting a PGCE without QTS means you will not be qualified to teach in most primary, secondary and special schools in England, although some schools will employ teachers without QTS.

If you get a PGCE without QTS you will not be entitled to the same benefits during your training and career as QTS with PGCE. For example, better pay and support when you start teaching.

## Benefits of having QTS with PGCE

A PGCE can give you a better understanding of teaching practices, educational research and theory.

It can also be beneficial if you want to teach in other countries because it’s an internationally recognised academic qualification. However, you should always check the local requirements of the country you’re looking to teach in.

It can also award up to 60 credits at master’s level which you could use towards a full master’s qualification. This is usually 180 credits.

You may want to do a master’s in education, for example, for your professional development and to gain additional expertise in your teaching career.

## Types of PGCE courses

You can get QTS with a PGCE in primary education or secondary education. Your course will involve both school placements and academic theory.

You can do this through a school-led, university-led, or an apprenticeship teacher training programme.

You can do a full or part-time PGCE course.

As part of selecting your course, you'll need to decide if you want to train to teach at a primary or secondary level. [Learn about the different age groups you could teach](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/age-groups-you-could-teach).

You can also do a PGCE without QTS in [further education](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/further-education-teachers).

### Entry requirements

Entry requirements for a postgraduate teacher training course usually include a bachelor's degree or equivalent qualification.

You also need the following GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above, or equivalent qualifications:

* English
* maths
* science (if you want to teach primary)

If you're not sure which route into teaching is right for you, [find routes into teaching based on your circumstances](/routes-into-teaching).

## What is a postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE)?

A PGDE in England is very similar to a PGCE, the difference being the number of academic credits you are awarded at the end of your course.

PGCE courses can contain up to 60 credits at master’s degree level, and PGDE courses can contain up to 120. This usually means that doing a PGDE will include more assignments.

As with PGCEs, you can do a PGDE in primary education or secondary education.

More teacher training providers offer a PGCE than a PGDE.
