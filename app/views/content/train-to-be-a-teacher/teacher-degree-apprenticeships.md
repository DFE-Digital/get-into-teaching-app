##  How do teacher degree apprenticeships work?
The teacher degree apprenticeship is a new teacher training programme where you’ll work in a school and earn a salary while getting a bachelor’s degree and [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).
 
The teaching apprenticeship is a 4-year, full-time course that lets you train as either a primary or secondary teacher with an accredited teacher training provider. Trainee teachers will spend an average of 40% of their time (two days a week) studying for their degree with a university.

The salary you’ll earn as a TDA will depend on the type of school you work in and where the school is.  

If you’re employed in a maintained school (schools funded by local authorities) as a TDA trainee, you’ll be paid on the unqualified teacher pay range.  

Non-maintained schools (for example, academies, independent schools and private schools) can set their own pay, but often follow the same pay ranges.   

You do not have to pay tuition fees, but you will not be eligible for student finance.
