##  How do teacher degree apprenticeships work?
The teacher degree apprenticeship is a new teacher training programme where you’ll work in a school and earn a salary while getting a bachelor’s degree and [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).
 
The teaching apprenticeship is a 4-year, full-time course that lets you train as either a primary or secondary teacher with an accredited teacher training provider. Trainee teachers will spend an average of 40% of their time (two days a week) studying for their degree with a university.

The salary you’ll earn as a trainee will reflect the level of responsibility that’s suitable for each stage of your teaching apprenticeship course. You do not have to pay tuition fees but you will not be eligible for student finance.

The teacher training providers confirmed so far will offer TDAs in secondary maths, with other subjects likely to be offered too.

The providers offering teacher degree apprenticeships are:

* Nottingham Trent University
* Staffordshire University, in partnership with the Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire Teacher Education Collective
* University College London
* University of Brighton
* University of Huddersfield
* University of Nottingham
* University of Wolverhampton
* Xavier Teach Southeast, in partnership with the University of Sussex
