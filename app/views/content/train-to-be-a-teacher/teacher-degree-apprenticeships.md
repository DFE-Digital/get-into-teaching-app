If you do not already have an undergraduate degree, you may be eligible to do a teacher degree apprenticeship (TDA), a new route to become a qualified teacher.

##  How do teacher degree apprenticeships (TDAs) work?
This new teacher training programme means you’ll work in a school and earn a salary while getting a bachelor’s degree and [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).
 
The teaching apprenticeship is a 4-year, full-time course that lets you train as either a primary or secondary teacher with an accredited teacher training provider. Trainee teachers will spend an average of 40% of their time (two days a week) studying for their degree with a university.

The salary you’ll earn as a trainee will reflect the level of responsibility that’s suitable for each stage of your course. You do not have to pay tuition fees but you will not be eligible for student finance.

The [teacher training providers confirmed so far](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/secondary-maths-teacher-degree-apprenticeship-funding-pilot-providers?) will offer TDAs in maths, with other subjects likely to be offered too.

## Who’s eligible to apply for a teacher degree apprenticeship (TDA)?
Teaching degree apprenticeships will be available to both people who are leaving school and those already working who are interested in becoming a teacher, including teaching assistants.

To be eligible to apply for a teacher apprenticeship degree you’ll need the following qualifications:

* GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary)
* A levels - the number of A levels and grades required will be set by individual universities

You also need to be:

* a resident of England for the last 3 years or more
* age 16 years or over
