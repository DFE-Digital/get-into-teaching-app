## Undergraduate degree courses
You need a bachelor’s degree in any subject to train to teach in primary, secondary and special schools in England. If you do not already have a degree, you can train to be a teacher as part of your bachelor’s degree and get [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).

You need QTS to teach in maintained primary, secondary and special schools in England (schools funded by local authorities).

As part of selecting your undergraduate degree course, you'll need to decide if you want to train to teach at a primary or secondary level. [Learn about deciding who to teach](/is-teaching-right-for-me/who-do-you-want-to-teach).

Full-time degree courses that include QTS typically cost $fees_ugitt$ per year and can take up to 4 years but you can get [funding for your training](/funding-and-support).

- Bachelor of Science (BSc)
