## Bachelor's degree courses
You need a bachelor’s degree in any subject to train to teach in primary, secondary and special schools in England. If you do not already have one, you can train to be a teacher as part of a bachelor’s degree and get [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).

You need QTS to teach in maintained primary, secondary and special schools in England (schools funded by local authorities).

As part of selecting your bachelor's degree course, you'll need to decide if you want to train to teach at a primary or secondary level. Explore:

* [age groups and specialisms](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms)
* [subjects you could teach](/life-as-a-teacher/explore-subjects) at secondary school level

Full-time bachelor's degree courses that include QTS typically cost $fees_ugitt$ per year and can take up to 4 years but you can get [funding for your training](/funding-and-support).

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get QTS with a:

- Bachelor of Arts (BA)
- Bachelor of Education (BEd)
- Bachelor of Science (BSc)

## Bursaries for undergraduate degrees

You may be eligible for a [bursary of $bursaries_undergraduate$](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2026-to-2027#undergraduate-bursary) if you do a secondary maths or physics course that leads to qualified teacher status (QTS).

You may also be eligible if you do an opt-in QTS course in secondary computing, languages, mathematics or physics. This is where you start a standard undergraduate degree but then opt-in to initial teacher training to get QTS.

The amount you receive depends on the year that you start your QTS course. You do not get a bursary in every year of an undergraduate course. Depending on the type of course you do, you may get the bursary in your final year or final 2 years.

### Undergraduate bursary if you're former military personnel

You may be eligible for a $bursaries_veteran_total$ tax-free undergraduate bursary for veterans if you’re:

* training to teach secondary biology, chemistry, computing, languages, maths, or physics
* doing an undergraduate degree leading to QTS in England

## Teacher degree apprenticeships (TDAs)
If you do not have a degree you may be eligible to apply for a TDA. This new course will allow you work in a school and earn a salary while getting a bachelor's degree and QTS. So you will not have to pay tuition fees.

## Other routes into teaching
You do not need a degree and QTS to [teach in further education](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/further-education-teachers) or to [teach in early years](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/early-years-teachers). So if you want to become a teacher but are not able to get a degree, you can explore these options.
