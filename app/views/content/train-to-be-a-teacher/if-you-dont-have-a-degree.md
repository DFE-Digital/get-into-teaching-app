You need a bachelor’s degree in any subject to train to teach in primary, secondary and special schools in England.

For secondary teacher training, your provider will also want to make sure you have a good knowledge of the subject you’re applying to teach.

If you do not already have one, you can train to be a teacher as part of your bachelor’s degree and get [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts).

QTS is what you need to teach in maintained primary, secondary and special schools in England (schools funded by local authorities).

Degree courses that include QTS typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years but you can get [funding for your training](/funding-and-support).
