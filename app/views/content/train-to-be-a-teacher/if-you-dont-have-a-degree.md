You need a bachelor’s degree to train to teach in primary, secondary and special schools in England. This does not have to be in teaching.

If you do not already have one, you can train to be a teacher as part of your bachelor’s degree and get [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/what-is-qts).

QTS is what you need to teach in maintained primary, secondary and special schools in England (schools funded by local authorities).

Degree courses that include QTS typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years but you can get [funding for your training](/funding-and-support).

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get QTS with a:

- Bachelor of Arts (BA)
- Bachelor of Education (BEd)
- Bachelor of Science (BSc)

As part of selecting your teacher training course, you will need to decide if you want to train to teach at a primary or secondary level. [Learn about deciding who to teach](/train-to-be-a-teacher/who-do-you-want-to-teach).

If you're a non-UK citizen who wants to study in England, you can visit the [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/) for information about studying at an English university.
