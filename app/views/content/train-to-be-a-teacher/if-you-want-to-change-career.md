A career change into teaching allows you to use the skills and expertise you’ve already developed to inspire young people.

You’ll need a degree and [qualified teacher status](/what-is-qts) (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools. There are different ways to get QTS.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) is a service that specifically helps people get into teaching who are changing career.

[Teacher training courses for graduates](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) may also work for you. If you have knowledge and experience in a particular subject area there are specific training courses you can choose.

If you're concerned about your subject knowledge, you may also be able to do a ['subject knowledge enhancement' (SKE) course](/what-subject-do-you-want-to-teach). This can help if you have an unrelated degree but relevant professional experience, or you haven't used your subject knowledge for a while.
