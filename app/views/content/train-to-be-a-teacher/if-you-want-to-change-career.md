A career change into teaching allows you to use the skills and expertise you’ve already developed to inspire young people.

You’ll need a degree and [qualified teacher status](/what-is-qts) (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools. There are different ways to get QTS.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) is a service that specifically helps people get into teaching who are changing career.

If you already have an undergraduate degree, you can [search for postgraduate teacher training courses](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) to get QTS.

If you're concerned about your subject knowledge, you may also be able to do a <a href="/how-to-apply/subject-knowledge-enhancement">'subject knowledge enhancement' (SKE) course</a>. This can help if you have an unrelated degree but relevant professional experience, or you haven't used your subject knowledge for a while.

Find information if you're a [non-UK citizen interested in teaching in England](/non-uk-teachers).
