All primary and secondary postgraduate teacher training courses include time spent in school placements with some theoretical learning. 

The main differences between courses are: 

* what you need to get onto the course
* the qualifications awarded by the course
* if the course is fee-paying or salaried 
* the type of course provider 
* if the course is full-time or part-time
* the course start date 

## What you need to get onto the course

Some training courses have specific eligibility requirements. 

It's important to check the requirements for each course you apply to on the training provider's course page. This is so you do not waste time on an application you’re unlikely to be successful with. 

### Your qualifications 

You need to have a degree in any subject to be able to train to teach. But the degree grade that course providers will accept may vary. For example, most providers will accept a minimum degree grade of 2:2, but some may require you to have a 2:1. So you’ll need to check each course provider’s requirements on their course page.

$qualifications$
$what-you-need-to-get-onto-the-course$

## The qualifications awarded by the course

Most primary and secondary schools in England need you to have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) to teach. Without QTS you may not be fully qualified to teach in your chosen school and will not receive the same pay and support when you start teaching.

Most teacher training courses will award QTS, but some will award QTS with a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-a-pgce).

If your teacher training course leads to QTS, [you may be eligible for a scholarship or bursary](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) to help you train.

## If the course is fee-paying or salaried

### Fee-paying teacher training

Most teacher training courses are fee-paying. This means you have to pay tuition fees and will not earn a salary while you train. 

There are ways to fund your training, for example, through tuition fee and maintenance loans. You may also be eligible for a bursary or scholarship.

$funding$
$fee-funded-teacher-training$

### Salaried teacher training

Some courses are salaried, which means you’ll receive an unqualified teacher’s salary while you train. Some salaried teacher training courses may also come with fees. Check with individual providers for more information.

Places on salaried courses are limited and very competitive. It’s usually wise to apply for fee-paying courses as well to increase your chances of getting a place on a course.

$salaried$
$salaried-teacher-training$

## The type of course provider 

Your teacher training course might be provided by: 

* a university, sometimes referred to as university-led training
* a school or group of schools, sometimes referred to as school-led training

Your teacher training course may also be provided by a company or charity. For example, [Teach First is a charitable organisation that provides teacher training](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk).

Once you’ve found a course you’re interested in, you can talk to the training provider before you apply. For example, you might want to find out: 

* where your placements and theoretical learning might happen
* how many schools you’ll be doing placements in and how long each placement will last 
* the start and finish dates of the course 

It’s a good idea to apply to a range of providers to increase your chances of being successful on a course. For example, if you’re applying for 4 courses, you might want to apply for 2 courses provided by universities, and 2 provided by schools.

You can apply to a maximum of 4 courses at one time. 

$what-to-check-with-training-providers$

## Full-time or part-time courses 

There are usually more full-time courses available than part-time.

Postgraduate teacher training usually takes 9 months full-time, or 18 to 24 months part-time.

## Adjustments and accessibility

Course providers can make adjustments if you need supoprt because you're neurodiverse, have a long-term physical or mental health condition, or have any other accessibility needs. Find out more about [adjustments to help you train](/train-to-be-a-teacher/accessibility-adjustments).

## Course start date

Most teacher training courses start in September, with a small number of courses starting on other dates throughout the year.
