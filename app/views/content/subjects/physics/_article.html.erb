    <h2 class="heading-s">Do you need a physics degree?</h2>
    <p>
      To train to teach physics in a school in England, you'll need a bachelor's degree, but it does not have to be in physics.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2022, candidates with degrees in subjects as varied as physiotherapy, psychology, and zoology were offered places on physics teacher training courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having relevant A levels can also show your subject knowledge, if you do not have a degree in physics.
