      <h2>What you'll be teaching</h2>
      <p>
      You'll teach the content of the national curriculum, with opportunities to develop your students’ ability to think like physicists and see physics as a solution to many challenges. The themes you are likely to cover include:
      </p>
      <p>
          11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3):
      </p>

          <li class="tag">Waves and matter</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4):
      </p>
       <ul class="vertical-tags">
        <li class="tag">Energy, forces and wave motion</li>
        <li class="tag">Electricity, magnetism and electromagnetism</li>
        <li class="tag">The structure of matter</li>
        <li class="tag">Atomic structure and space physics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        16 to 18 year olds (key stage 5):
      </p>
       <ul class="vertical-tags">
        <li class="tag">Fields, vectors and scalars</li>
        <li class="tag">Mechanics and mechanical properties of matter</li>
        <li class="tag">Electric circuits and waves</li>
        <li class="tag">Matter, quantum and nuclear physics</li>

    <p>You can also search for past exam papers online to see the type of questions that were asked in previous years.</p>

    <p>
      You may also get the opportunity to teach other subjects, particularly for 11 to 16 year olds and in some cases for post-16. This will vary depending on individual schools.

    <h3>Check your qualifications</h3>
    <p>
      To train to teach physics in England, you'll need a bachelor's degree, but it does not have to be in physics.
    <p>
      In 2022, candidates with degrees in subjects as varied as physiotherapy, psychology, and zoology were offered places on physics teacher training courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having relevant A levels can show your subject knowledge, if you do not have a degree in physics.
