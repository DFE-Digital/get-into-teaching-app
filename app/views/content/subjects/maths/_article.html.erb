    <h2>The language of everything</h2>

    <p>
      Maths is the language we use to find patterns and understand the world
      around us. It has provided the solutions to some of history's most
      intriguing problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maths is essential to everyday life, critical to science, technology and
      engineering as well as being fundamental for most jobs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maths has a critical role to play in the future of the UK economy. There is
      significant evidence that adults with numeracy skills earn higher wages and
      are more likely to be in employment than those who do not master these skills.

    <h2>Some examples of what you teach 11 to 14 year olds:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        understand that the probabilities of all possible outcomes sum to 1
      </li>
      <li>
        work with terminating decimals and their equivalent fractions (such as
        0.25 and 1/4, or 3.5 and 7/2)
      </li>
      <li>
        recognise, sketch and produce graphs of linear and quadratic functions.
        Use appropriate scaling with equations in <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>
        and the Cartesian plane
      </li>
      <li>
        use Pythagoras' Theorem and trigonometric ratios in similar triangles.
        Solve problems involving right-angled triangles
      </li>
      <li>
        describe simple mathematical relationships between 2 variables in
        observational and experimental contexts. Show this using scatter graphs
