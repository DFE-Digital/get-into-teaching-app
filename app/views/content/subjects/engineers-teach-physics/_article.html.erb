    <h2>The classroom needs you</h2>

    <p>
      Continue your engineering career by getting into the classroom and use your skills and passion to inspire the next generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need more physics teachers. Without them children are missing out on the opportunity to develop their understanding of the world around them. Engineers bring a unique and innovative perspective into the physics classroom, helping to explain big things to young minds.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to train a diverse range of physics teachers who can pass on their knowledge in exciting and interesting ways to inspire the engineers of the future.

      Engineers and physicists help find solutions to some of our biggest problems. From climate change to secure energy sources, we need their problem-solving skills and creative thinking to help us survive some of the biggest challenges humanity has ever faced.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more great physics teachers we have in the classroom today, the more children will grow up inspired to become the physicists, engineers and physics teachers of tomorrow.

    <h2>Physics teacher training programme</h2>

    <p>This new teacher training programme helps engineers become physics teachers. Applications will open at the end of March 2022. To get more information about the course and application process, you can talk to a teacher training adviser. They can help you to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>understand more about the course</li>
      <li>make an application</li>
      <li>prepare for your interview</li>
    </ul>

          My engineering degree provided a natural transition to teaching physics and I value the way science – especially physics – teaches a clear thought process and a way to make rational sense of the world.
