    <h2>The classroom needs you</h2>

    <p>
      Continue your engineering career by getting into the classroom and use your skills and passion to inspire the next generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need more physics teachers. Without them children are missing out on the opportunity to develop their understanding of the world around them. Engineers bring a unique and innovative perspective into the physics classroom, helping to explain big things to young minds.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to train a diverse range of physics teachers who can pass on their knowledge in exciting and interesting ways to inspire the engineers of the future.

      Engineers and physicists help find solutions to some of our biggest problems. From climate change to the energy crisis, we need their problem-solving and creative thinking to help us survive some of the most critical crises humanity has ever faced.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more great physics teachers we have in the classroom today, the more children will grow up inspired to become physicists, engineers and physics teachers tomorrow.

          My engineering degree provided a natural transition to teaching physics and I value the way science – especially physics – teaches a clear thought process and a way to make rational sense of the world.
