      <h2>What you'll be teaching</h2>
      <p>Computing for key stages 1 to 4 focuses on 3 pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>information and communication technology  </li>

<li>digital literacy </li>
<li>computer science </li>
</ul>
<p>At GCSE and A Level you will teach computer science. You could teach the national curriculum, with opportunities to develop your students’ computational thinking.  </p>
<p>11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3): </p>
<p>
When teaching the lower key stages, you could use interactive exercises during your lessons, like creating a robot car.   </p>

        <li class="tag">Algorithms</li>
        <li class="tag">Programming and debugging   </li>

        <li class="tag">Uses of technology  </li>
        <li class="tag">Online safety </li>

      </ul>

      <p>14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4): </p>
      <p>You will teach computer science as a qualification at GCSE. You will teach pupils how to develop their capability, creativity and knowledge in computing through the KS4 curriculum and code and prepare them for future studies. </p>
      <ul class="vertical-tags">
        <li class="tag">Computational thinking</li>

      </ul>
       <p>16 to 18 year olds (key stage 5):  </p>
      <p>At key stage 5, you will teach computer science as a qualification at A level and encourage pupils to develop a broad range of the knowledge, understanding and skills of computer scienceing, preparing them for further learning or employment in this area.  </p>

     <p>You can also search for past exam papers online to see the type of questions that were asked in previous years.</p>
    <p>You may also get the opportunity to teach other subjects, particularly for 11 to 16 year olds and in some cases for post-16. This will vary depending on individual schools.

    <h2 class="heading-s">Funding for teaching computing </h2>

    <p>To train to be a computing teacher, you will need to do a teacher training course. </p>

<p>Bursaries of £28,000 are available for [link]eligible trainee computing teachers. </p>

<p>Scholarships of £30,000 are available for computing teacher training courses.  </p>

 <p>You can receive this alongside a tuition fee and maintenance loan. </p>

  <p>You may be able to get extra funding support if you' are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a parent or carer </li>
      <li>disabled </li>
    </ul>

<p>Non-UK citizens without indefinite leave to remain in the UK are unlikely to be eligible. </p>
    <p><a href="/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries">Check your eligibility for bursaries and scholarships</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-s">Check your qualifications</h2>

    <p>To train to teach in primary and secondary schools in England, you’ll need: </p>
    <ul>

<li>GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary) </li>
<li>a bachelor’s degree in any subject </li>
</ul>
<p>Your training provider may need you to brush up on your computing knowledge before you become a computing teacher. You can do a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course before you start your teacher training to top up your subject knowledge. </p>

    <p><a href="/is-teaching-right-for-me/qualifications-you-need-to-teach">Find out about the qualifications needed to teach</a>.</p>

<h2 class="heading-s">Paid internship </h2>

    <p>If you’re currently doing an undergraduate or master's degree and are interested in teaching computing, you could apply for a paid teaching internship. </p>
<p>The 3 week programme could help you to understand what it’s really like in the classroom and get a feel for school life. </p>
<p>You can also find out what it's like to be in a classroom through unpaid school experience. </p>
