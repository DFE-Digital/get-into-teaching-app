## Decade dilemmas – exploring people’s career aspirations in the wake of 2020

Kindred Agency commissioned research company Censuswide to carry out a survey on behalf of the Get Into Teaching campaign to explore people’s job or career aspirations at the start of the year and how these have changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
The purpose of the survey was aimed at gaining further insights about those who may be considering a career change. It covers the kind of things respondents want to do more of as a result of their experiences and all they have learnt or reflected on. Teaching as a career is explored as part of the research as well as people’s attitudes to teachers following their efforts as key workers during the pandemic and in society more generally.

## Exploring the career aspirations of students and graduates and what it takes to teach

Kindred Agency commissioned research company Censuswide to carry out two surveys on behalf of the Get Into Teaching campaign – one to explore the career aspirations of students and recent graduates, and alongside this a survey asking teachers to cite the key attributes they believe are needed to do their job and the aspects of teaching they believe would most appeal to new recruits.

For students and recent graduates, the purpose of the survey was also to provide insights about the qualities and skills they most possess, as well as what they most hope to gain when considering a future career, including teaching. For the teacher survey, the purpose was to understand what attributes and skills they believed to be most useful for being a teacher, the best aspects of their job and what it enables them to do.
