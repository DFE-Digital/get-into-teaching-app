## Decade dilemmas – exploring people’s career aspirations in the wake of 2020

Kindred Agency commissioned research company Censuswide to carry out a survey on behalf of the Get Into Teaching campaign to explore people’s job or career aspirations at the start of the year and how these have changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
The purpose of the survey was aimed at gaining further insights about those who may be considering a career change. It covers the kind of things respondents want to do more of as a result of their experiences and all they have learnt or reflected on. Teaching as a career is explored as part of the research as well as people’s attitudes to teachers following their efforts as key workers during the pandemic and in society more generally.
