    <div class="inset">
      <p>Chemistry underpins everything, so you'll be amazed at the questions your pupils will start asking. Leading hands-on lab experiments and creating engaging lessons will mean no two days are the same in the classroom.</p>
      <p>In addition to the personal rewards of teaching chemistry, there are practical benefits too, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/pay-and-benefits">competitive salary starting at <%= value :salaries_starting_minshortened %></a> (or higher in London)</li>
        <li>a <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/pay-and-benefits/teachers-pension-scheme">generous and secure pension</a></li>
        <li>more holiday days than people in many other professions</li>
        <li>opportunities for progression</li>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Shape your pupils' futures</h2>
    <div class="inset">
      <p>Teaching chemistry opens the door for your pupils to pursue exciting careers in fields as diverse as medicine and forensic science, to palaeontology and oceanography.</p>
      <p>By solving challenging problems, your pupils could make significant contributions to these diverse and impactful areas.</p>
      <p>Your pupils will learn more from you than you might think.  As their teacher, youâ€™ll guide your pupils though the skills they need to show their understanding of chemistry. You will teach them valuable life skills such as critical thinking, decision making and communication.</p>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">What you'll teach</h2>
    <p>You'll teach the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study">national curriculum for chemistry</a>.</p>
    <p>You could have the opportunity to teach or support physics and biology lessons throughout key stages 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>When you teach 11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3), you'll cover themes from the 3 science disciplines of chemistry, biology and physics.</p>
    <p>The chemistry themes are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the particulate nature of matter</li>
      <li>atoms, elements and compounds</li>
      <li>pure and impure substances</li>
      <li>chemical reactions</li>
      <li>energetics</li>
      <li>the periodic table</li>
      <li>materials</li>
      <li>earth and atmosphere</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Themes you'll cover when you teach 14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4) will be more specific to chemistry, and include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>atomic structure and the periodic table</li>
      <li>structure, bonding and the properties of matter</li>
      <li>chemical changes</li>
      <li>energy changes in chemistry</li>
      <li>rate and extent of chemical change</li>
      <li>chemical analysis</li>
      <li>chemical and allied industries</li>
      <li>earth and atmospheric science</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Teaching pupils at different ages and abilities means you'll always be expanding your knowledge and approach to meet pupils' needs. Once you have qualified teacher status (QTS) you can also teach any other subject, as long as you can show you have enough expertise.</p>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Start your journey into teaching chemistry</h2>
    <h3>Check your qualifications</h3>
    <p>To train to teach chemistry in England, you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary)</li>
      <li>a bachelor's degree in any subject</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Having relevant A levels can show your subject knowledge, if you do not have a degree in chemistry.</p>
    <p>Chemistry teacher training courses have had successful applications from candidates with a range of degrees, including biomedical sciences, forensic science, pharmacy, and natural sciences.

  </section>

  <section class="col col-720">
    <h3>Improve your subject knowledge</h3>
    <p>If your training provider thinks you need to top up your subject knowledge in chemistry before you become a teacher, you can do a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course.</p>
    <p>There are lots of reasons why someone might need to complete an SKE course. For example, if you finished your degree more than 5 years ago or if you have an A level but not a degree in the subject you want to teach.</p>

    <p><a href="/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries"> Tax-free bursaries of <%= v :bursaries_postgraduate_chemistry %> or scholarships of <%= v :scholarships_chemistry %></a> are available for eligible trainee chemistry teachers.</p>
    <p>You can get a bursary or scholarship alongside a tuition fee and maintenance loan. Even if you've had financial support for a previous course, you could still be eligible for funding to support your teacher training.</p>
    <p>You may also be able to get <a href="/funding-and-support">extra funding and support</a> if you're:</p>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Support with teacher training</h2>
    <p>Throughout your initial teacher training in chemistry, you'll have the support of a mentor.</p>
    <p>Your mentor will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>guide you through your training, sharing learning and career development opportunities with you</li>
      <li>meet with you regularly to make sure your training is a positive experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll also be part of a welcoming school community where you'll learn from fellow teachers through taught sessions, seminars and workshops.</p>
    <p>Once you've completed your initial teacher training, you'll continue to be supported during your first 2 years of teaching. Find out what support you'll get as <a href="/support-for-early-career-teachers">an early career teacher</a>.</p>
