    <p>I’ve always loved listening to rap music. I was just 12 when I started writing my own songs and spoken word poems. I just couldn’t get enough of the lyrics – I was constantly trying to unpick them. They can really change how you see the world. When I started teaching, I thought this would be a great thing to take into the classroom.</p>
    <p>Lots of the English curriculum is classic texts and the kids sometimes find it hard to relate to. Rap just makes it more relevant.</p>

    <p>When I started rapping in the classroom, the kids were all saying, “Miss, you can’t rap, you’re a teacher!” The next day, I brought in my speakers and started doing it. You could see them thinking, “Wow, this a different way of learning.” Even the quiet ones started speaking up, which is what it’s all about.</p>
    <p>My advice to you? Focus on what you love about your subject. When you show a part of yourself to the students, you can connect with them better.</p>
