Teachers come from lots of different backgrounds and have often worked in previous careers before becoming teachers. The skills and experiences you bring from previous careers are invaluable in the classroom. From communication and public speaking, to problem solving and people management, your students will learn more from you than you might think. 

So if you're interested in changing careers to become a teacher, there's lots of support available to help you find your route into teaching.

## What you need in order to become a teacher

Youâ€™ll need a degree and [qualified teacher status](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools. There are different ways to get QTS.

### If you have a degree 

If you already have a degree, you can do a [postgraduate teacher training course](/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-have-a-degree) to get QTS. 

It doesn't matter when you graduated, and your degree subject doesn't necessarily need to be the subject you want to teach. Once you have QTS you may be able to also teach various subjects, as long as you can show you have enough expertise. For example, through your previous career. 

If you're concerned about your subject knowledge, you may also be able to do a [subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course](/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement). This can help if you have an unrelated degree but relevant professional experience, or you haven't used your subject knowledge for a while.

### If you do not have a degree 

If you do not have a degree, you can:

* do undergraduate teacher training to get a degree alongside qualified teacher status QTS
* check if you're elgible to do a teaching degree apprenticeship

Find out more about [training to teach if you do not have a degree](/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-dont-have-a-degree).  

### Teaching in further education and early years

You do not need a degree and QTS to [teach in further education](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/further-education-teachers) or to [teach in early years](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/early-years-teachers). So if you want to become a teacher, but are not able to get a degree, you can explore these options. 

## Fund your teacher training

[Tax-free bursaries and scholarships](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) are available for eligible trainee teachers.

You can get a bursary or scholarship alongside a tuition fee and maintenance loan. Even if you've had financial support for a previous course, you could still be eligible for funding to support your teacher training.

You may also be able to get [extra funding and support](/funding-and-support) if you're:

* a parent or carer
* disabled
* a veteran

## Support with teacher training 

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) is a service that specifically helps people get into teaching who are changing career.

Throughout your initial teacher training, you'll have the support of a mentor. Your mentor will:

* guide you through your training, sharing learning and career development opportunities with you
* meet with you regularly to make sure your training is a positive experience

You'll also be part of a welcoming school community where you'll learn from fellow teachers through taught sessions, seminars and workshops.
