One of the great benefits of a teaching career is a secure pension that will help you save for your future. 


## How the teachers' pension works

You’ll automatically be enrolled into the pension scheme at the start of your career. You'll remain in the scheme if you move teaching jobs, unless you opt out. 

Under the scheme, you'll automatically pay from your salary into your pension each month. At the same time, your employer also contributes.

Once you join the scheme, it's quick and easy to manage your pension online.

## Salary-based pension contributions

The teachers' pension scheme includes an employer contribution of 28.6%.

It’s a defined benefit pension, which means it’s based on your salary rather than the amount you contribute.

If your salary increases, the pension contributions you and your employer make will increase too. You can also choose to pay extra contributions if you want to. [Learn more about paying extra contributions on the teachers' pension scheme website](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/working-life/paying-in/increasing-your-pension/additional-pension.aspx).

## Teachers' pension contributions are tax-free

Teachers' pension contributions are tax-free, as the scheme is registered with HM Revenue and Customs.

It’s also one of only 8 pension schemes backed by the government. This means that it’s not reliant on pension money being invested elsewhere.

The scheme is flexible so you can convert part of your pension early as a tax-free lump sum. 

## Financial protection for your family

If you became ill during your career, you could apply for early ill-health retirement.

If you were to die while actively paying into your pension, a nominated beneficiary would receive a death grant. After 2 years of paying into your pension, a nominated beneficiary would also receive a pension after you die.
