    <div class="inset">
      <p>Design and technology is a broad subject. Your teaching will cover a diverse range of areas including maths, science, engineering, art, and cookery. You'll encourage pupils to solve problems creatively and consider how the technology they use can impact their designs and the environment.</p>
      <p>In addition to the personal rewards of teaching design and technology, there are practical benefits too, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/teacher-pay-and-benefits">competitive salary starting at <%= value :salaries_starting_minshortened %></a> (or higher in London)</li>
        <li>a <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/what-pension-does-a-teacher-get">generous and secure pension</a></li>
        <li>more holiday days than people in many other professions</li>
        <li>opportunities for progression</li>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Shape your pupils' futures</h2>
      <p>Teaching design and technology opens the door for your pupils to pursue exciting careers in fields as diverse as interior design and architecture to engineering and joinery.</p>
      <p>By solving challenging problems, your pupils could make significant contributions to these diverse and impactful areas.</p>
      <p>Your pupils will learn more from you than you might think. As their teacher, you will guide your pupils though the skills they need to show their understanding of design and technology. You will teach them valuable life skills such as critical thinking, decision making and communication.</p>

    <p>Throughout key stage 3 (11 to 14 year olds) pupils will use their creativity to design and make products that solve real problems within a variety of contexts. Pupils will be taught to:</p>
    <ul>
       <il>cook and apply the principles of nutrition and healthy eating</il>
       <il>identify and understand user needs</il>
       <il>identify and solve their own design problems and understand how to reformulate problems given to them</il>
       <il>develop and communicate design ideas</il> 
       <il>select from and use specialist tools, techniques, processes, equipment and machinery precisely</il>
       <il>analyse the work of others to develop and broaden their understanding</il>
       <il>investigate new and emerging technologies</il>
       <il>test, evaluate and refine their ideas and products against a specification</il>
