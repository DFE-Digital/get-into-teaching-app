    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Applying for teacher training</h2>
    <p>When you apply for teacher training, you'll need to include things like proof of qualifications, and a written personal statement explaining why you want to become a teacher.<p>
    <p>To help show your qualifications, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate">get a certified statement of your exam results</a> if you did GCSEs, CSEs, O levels or A levels in the UK. If you have a degree, you should also be able to request a copy of your degree certificate from the university where you studied in the UK.</p>
    <p>If it's been a while since you've applied for a training course, you can get one-to-one guidance from a teacher training adviser. For example, they can support you with writing a personal statement and preparing for interviews. You can also explore our guidance on <a href="/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training">how to apply for teacher training</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">During your training and early career</h3>
    <p>Your training will equip you with all the knowledge you need to thrive in teaching environments.</p>
    <p>You'll also get lots of support while you train. For example, if you do postgraduate initial teacher training, you'll have the support of a mentor.</p>
    <p>Your mentor will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>guide you through your training, sharing learning and career development opportunities with you</li>
      <li>meet with you regularly to make sure your training is a positive experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All teacher training involves some form of school placement. Throughout your time in schools, you'll be part of a welcoming school community where you'll learn from fellow teachers through taught sessions, seminars and workshops.</p>
    <p>Once you've completed your initial teacher training, you'll continue to be supported during your first 2 years of teaching. Find out what support you'll get as <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/teaching-as-a-career/early-career-teachers">an early career teacher</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Financial support</h2>
    <p>There are lots of financial support options available for trainee teachers. For example, you may be able to get bursaries and scholarships, student loans, or a training route without fees. The financial support options vary depending on the teacher training route and eligibility criteria.</p>
