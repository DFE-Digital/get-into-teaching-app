    <p>After college, I went travelling and then spent my twenties trying out different careers. I worked in HR for 5 years while also doing a part-time degree in physical science through The Open University - achieving a first. I also became a mum, too. </p>
    <p>Whilst on maternity leave, I saw the advert for teacher training and saw that with my degree and the subject I wanted to teach, I’d even get a bursary.</p>

    <p>I wouldn’t say I look like your stereotypical physics teacher, and I probably don’t act like one. I have bleached blonde hair and I’m a single mum for a start.</p>
    <p>Working with young people and helping them to understand the world around them is massively rewarding. I love that I can be creative, manage my own classroom and make science fun – which is, after all, the first step in getting students to learn.</p>
    <p>I now have job security, opportunities for progression, new skills and a postgraduate qualification. Not to mention the new car that isn’t falling apart, a well-deserved holiday booked, paid-off credit cards and a little put away for a rainy day.</p>
