    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">What you'll need to become a teacher</h2>
    <p>You’ll need a degree and <a href="/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts">qualified teacher status (QTS)</a> to work in the majority of schools in England. This includes state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.</p>
    <p>There are different ways to get QTS.</p>

    <h3>If you have a degree</h3>
    <p>If you already have a degree, you can do a postgraduate teacher training course to gain QTS.</p>
    <p>It does not matter when you graduated, and your degree subject does not necessarily need to be in the subject you want to teach. Once you have QTS, you can also teach any other subject, as long as you can show you have enough expertise.</p>
    <h4>Funding postgraduate teacher training</h4>
    <p>Most postgraduate teacher training courses charge fees. There are ways to fund your training, for example, through tuition fee and maintenance loans. If you train to teach certain subjects, you may also be eligible for a bursary or scholarship of up to <%= v :scholarships_generic_maxshortened %>.</p>
    <p>Other postgraduate teacher training courses come with a salary, which means you get paid while you train. Some salaried courses may also charge fees. These courses are in high demand and very competitive, so it’s important to apply as soon as you can if you’re eligible.</p>
    <p>If you’re eligible for a bursary or scholarship, you could receive more money on a non-salaried course than on a salaried one.</p>

    <h3>If you do not have a degree</h3>
    <p>If you do not have a degree, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>do undergraduate teacher training to get a degree alongside qualified teacher status (QTS)</li>
      <li>check if you're eligible to do a teacher degree apprenticeship</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Funding undergraduate teacher training</h4>
    <p>Undergraduate teacher training courses can be funded through tuition fee and maintenance loans. You may also be eligible for a bursary of <%= v :bursaries_undergraduate %>.</p>
    <p>Teacher degree apprenticeships allow you work in a school and earn a salary while getting a bachelor’s degree, so you do not have to pay tuition fees.</p>

    <h3>If you do not want to get a degree</h3>
    <p>You do not need a degree and QTS to <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/further-education-teachers">teach in further education</a> or to <a href="/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/early-years-teachers">teach in early years</a>. So if you want to become a teacher, but are not able to get a degree, you can explore these options.</p>
    <h3>If you're a teaching assistant</h3>
    <p>If you're a teaching assistant, your valuable classroom experience might make you a desirable candidate for teacher training. You'll still need a degree and QTS to teach in most schools, which you can achieve through the same routes as other career changers.</p>
    <p>If you've been a teaching assistant for 2 years and have taught classes independently, you may be eligible for the <a href="/train-to-be-a-teacher/assessment-only-route-to-qts">assessment only route to QTS</a>.</p>
