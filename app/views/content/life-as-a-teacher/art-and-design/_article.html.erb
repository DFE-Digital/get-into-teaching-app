    <div class="inset">
    <p>Teaching art and design gives pupils the technical skills needed to express their ideas in a wide variety of materials and media. You'll help pupils develop their own skills by encouraging them to critically review their work. Your pupils will develop an appreciation of art and design, and of the diverse ideas and perspectives of others.</p>
