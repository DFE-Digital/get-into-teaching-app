Special educational needs and disabilities can affect pupils’ ability to learn. For example, they may struggle to read or write because they have dyslexia, or they may have difficulties concentrating. Some pupils may have physical impairments which means they need special equipment to help them learn.  

Teaching pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) offers you a unique opportunity to make a lasting impact in their lives. You’ll help pupils overcome challenges and guide them to discover their strengths and fulfil their potential. Through your support, they’ll build self-esteem and resilience.

Working with pupils with complex needs can be incredibly fulfilling. You’ll have the opportunity to: 

* develop innovative teaching methods 
* gain a deep understanding of diverse learning needs 
* nurture a supportive learning environment  
* advocate for inclusivity  

Teachers who focus on supporting pupils with SEND are often called SEND teachers, but all teachers teach children with complex needs. Whether you train to teach in mainstream or special schools, or both, you’ll learn how to teach pupils with SEND. 

## SEND-focused teaching roles

You can choose to specialise in teaching and nurturing pupils with SEND in a more SEND-focused role. This could be through:
  
* teaching in a special school
* becoming a special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO)
* completing the mandatory qualification in sensory impairment (MQSI)

### Teaching in a special school

Special schools provide education for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. Special schools with pupils aged 11 and older can specialise in 1 of the 4 [areas of special educational needs](https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs): 

* communication and interaction 

* cognition and learning 

* social, emotional and mental health 

* sensory and physical needs 

During your initial teacher training, you may have the opportunity to have one of your school placements in a special school. This can enhance your understanding of how to plan and teach more effectively for all children.  

### Becoming a special educational needs co-ordinator

A special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) assesses, plans and monitors the progress of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities in mainstream schools. SENCOs also support teachers and teaching assistants in a range of ways including providing training, observing lessons and developing learning plans for pupils. 

As a SENCO you will get to know the specific needs of pupils who need extra support, so you can help them to feel comfortable and confident before teaching starts. 

To become a SENCO, you’ll need to gain [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) through initial teacher training and then complete a mandatory [SENCO national professional qualification (SENCO NPQ)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/special-educational-needs-co-ordinators-national-professional-qualification). You do not need to complete the NPQ before taking a SENCO role, you have 3 years to complete the qualification. 

As well as focusing on supporting pupils with SEND, many SENCOs will also teach in their main subject area. 

### Mandatory qualification in sensory impairment

To teach pupils with hearing impairments, vision impairments or multi-sensory impairments you’ll need a [mandatory qualification in sensory impairment (MQSI)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mandatory-qualifications-specialist-teachers) in addition to QTS.  

An MQSI will give you the skills needed to recognise pupils’ barriers to learning and help them overcome these. 

## Training for teaching pupils with SEND

All initial teacher training courses cover teaching pupils with SEND. Once you have gained QTS, you can look for courses that specialise in SEND to develop your training further. 

You can [find a teacher training course](https://find-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/) and filter by ‘courses with a SEND specialism’ if you have a particular interest in the area.
