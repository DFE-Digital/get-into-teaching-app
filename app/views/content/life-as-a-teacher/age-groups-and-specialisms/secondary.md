    text: "I specifically wanted to work with children identified with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). I was fortunate to find a teacher training course provider that was able to allow me to practice in a mainstream school that also hosted a hearing impairment unit. And another school that offered support for children with a variety of learning needs. They were great at teaching me and letting me practice my classroom management skills early on. I was able to research and understand ways to differentiate resources for children who were on the autistic spectrum. And I was able to create and implement a scheme of work to reflect on and evaluate for later use once qualified."
