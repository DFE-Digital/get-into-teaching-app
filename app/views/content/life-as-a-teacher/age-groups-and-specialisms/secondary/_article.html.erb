    <p> Secondary (ages 11 to 18)</p>
    <p>Children start secondary school when theyâ€™re 11. There are up to 3 stages in secondary school:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>key stage 3 (KS3) includes years 7 to 9, with children aged 11 to 14</li> 
     <li>key stage 4 (KS4) includes years 10 and 11, with pupils aged 14 to 16</li>
     <li>key stage 5 (KS5) includes years 12 and 13, with students aged 16 to 18 at secondary schools with sixth forms, or colleges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pupils work towards national qualifications, which are usually GCSEs during KS4. Pupils take A levels or other similar qualifications during KS5.</p>
    <p>Subjects at this level include core subjects such as English, maths and science, as well as many others. The full range of subjects available to teach at secondary level will depend on the school.</p>

    <h2>What you need to teach in secondary schools</h2> 
    <p>To teach in the majority of secondary schools, you will need to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS). There are a number of routes to this. [Find out what training you need to get QTS](/train-to-be-a-teacher).</p>
    <p>Once you have QTS, you're qualified to teach in primary and secondary schools. However, if you want to change from primary to secondary or secondary to primary, you'll need to be able to show you have relevant classroom experience.</p>
