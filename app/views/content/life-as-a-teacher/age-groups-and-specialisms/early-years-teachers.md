The early years are critical in children’s development. As an early years teacher you’ll work with young children up to the age of 5. You’ll use your knowledge and skills to help young children enjoy high standards of teaching and open their minds to new ideas every day.

You’ll need to do early years initial teacher training (EYITT) or an early years teacher degree apprenticeship (EYTDA) to achieve early years teacher status (EYTS). This will allow you to work in a nursery or early years setting, as well as academies, free schools and independent schools.

If you want to teach in a primary school, including in a reception class then you'll need to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS). [Find out more about training to teach primary pupils](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/primary).

If you're interested in exploring other opportunities to work with pre-school children, you can [find out more about a range of careers in early years education](https://earlyyearscareers.campaign.gov.uk/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=GiT). 

## What you need to become an early years teacher

There are several ways to train to become an early years teacher. These routes include postgraduate options if you already have a degree, an undergraduate degree, or an early years teacher degree apprenticeship. 

To do postgraduate training, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree or an equivalent, for example, a vocational or professional qualification, or equivalent qualification you gained outside the UK.

To start early years teacher training, you’ll need these GCSE qualifications:

* maths grade 4 (C)
* English grade 4 (C)
* science grade 4 (C)

If you do not have GCSEs, you'll need an equivalent qualification, such as a vocational or professional qualification, or an equivalent qualification you gained outside the UK.
