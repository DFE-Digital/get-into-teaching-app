  By teaching pupils languages, you can help them gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the world. As they learn a new language, your pupils will get a unique insight into the countries that speak these languages.</p>
  <p>
  Bursaries of $bursaries_postgraduate_languagesother$ are available for all trainee language teachers. These bursaries include ancient languages.</p> 
  <p>
  If you're training to teach French, German or Spanish, then you could be eligible for a scholarship of $scholarships_languagesfrenchgermanspanish$.</p>
