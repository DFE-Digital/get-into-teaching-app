    <p>Teaching art and design gives pupils the technical skills needed to express their ideas through a range of materials and forms of media. You'll help pupils develop their own skills by encouraging them to critically review their work. Your pupils will develop an appreciation of art and design, and of the diverse ideas and perspectives of others.</p>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Shape your pupils' futures</h2>
      <p>Teaching art and design opens the door for your pupils to pursue exciting careers. They could work in a diverse range of fields, from fashion and textiles, to illustration and video game design.</p>
