    <p>You'll teach the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-geography-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-geography-programmes-of-study">national curriculum for geography</a>.</p>
    <p>Throughout key stage 3 pupils will gain a curiosity about the world through studying a diverse range of people and places.</p>
    <p>When you teach 11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3), you'll help pupils demonstrate knowledge and skills in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>consolidating knowledge of the world's major countries</li>
      <li>understanding geographical similarities and differences between locations</li>
      <li>exploring physical geography such as rocks, weathering and climate</li>
      <li>investigating human geography such as population, urban development and economic activity</li>
      <li>understanding how human and physical processes can change landscapes</li>
      <li>building on skills using maps, globes and aerial photographs</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Knowledge and skills you'll cover when you teach 14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4) include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>developing and extending knowledge of locations</li>
      <li>extending competence in skills used in fieldwork, in using maps and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
      <li>analysing primary and secondary data</li>
      <li>applying geographical knowledge, understanding, skills and approaches to real world contexts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At A level and AS level (key stage 5), youâ€™ll help pupils develop a deeper knowledge and understanding of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>locations, places, processes and environments, at all geographical scales</li>
      <li>the role of fieldwork as a tool to understand and generate new knowledge about the real world</li>
      <li>selecting and using a range of quantitative and qualitative skills and approaches</li>
      <li>becoming critical and reflective learners</li>
    </ul>
