    <div class="inset">
      <p>Teaching geography opens up a huge range of opportunities for pupils' careers. From urban planners and business analysts to cartographers and climatologists, the career options after studying geography are incredibly diverse.</p>
      <p>Your pupils will learn more from you than you might think. As their teacher, you will guide them through the skills they need to show their understanding of both human and physical geography. You will teach them practical skills from map reading and data collection, to critical thinking and problem solving.</p>
