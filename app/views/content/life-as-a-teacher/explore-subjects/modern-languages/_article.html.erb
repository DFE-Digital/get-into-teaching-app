    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Shape your pupils' futures</h2>
      <p>Learning a new language will give pupils cultural awareness and enhanced communication skills that can lead to exciting careers.</p>
      <p>Popular careers range from flight attendants and ski instructors to interpreters and tour guides. Pupils may also have advantages in careers such as journalism, public relations or finance.</p>
      <p>Your pupils will learn more from you that you might think. As their teacher, you will guide your pupils though the skills they need to show their understanding of languages. You will teach them valuable life skills such as enhanced listening, cultural awareness and communication.</p>
