    <p>You'll teach the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study">national curriculum for <%= @front_matter["subject"] %></a>.</p>
    <p>You could have the opportunity to teach or support physics and chemistry lessons throughout key stages 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>When you teach 11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3), you'll cover themes from the 3 science disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics.</p>
    <p>The biology themes are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>structure and function of living organisms</li>
      <li>material cycles and energy</li>
      <li>interactions and interdependencies</li>
      <li>genetics and evolution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Themes you'll cover when you teach 14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4) will be more specific to <%= @front_matter["subject"] %>, and include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cell biology</li>
      <li>transport systems</li>
      <li>health, disease and the development of medicines</li>
      <li>coordination and control</li>
      <li>photosynthesis</li>
      <li>ecosystems</li>
      <li>evolution, inheritance and variation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Explore what teaching a key stage 4 <%= @front_matter["subject"] %> lesson would be like at the<a href="https://www.thenational.academy/teachers/curriculum/science-secondary/units"> Oak National Academy website</a>.</p>
    <p>At A level and AS level (key stage 5), youâ€™ll help pupils develop a deeper knowledge and understanding of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>biodiversity</li>
      <li>exchange and transport</li>
      <li>cells</li>
      <li>biological molecules</li>
      <li>ecosystems</li>
      <li>control systems</li>
      <li>genetics and evolution</li>
      <li>energy for biological processes</li>
