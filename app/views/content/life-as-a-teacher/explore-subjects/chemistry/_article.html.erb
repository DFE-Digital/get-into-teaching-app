    <p>You'll teach the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study">national curriculum for <%= @front_matter["subject"] %></a>.</p>
    <p>You could have the opportunity to teach or support physics and biology lessons throughout key stages 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>When you teach 11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3), you'll cover themes from the 3 science disciplines of chemistry, biology and physics.</p>
    <p>The chemistry themes are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the particulate nature of matter</li>
      <li>atoms, elements and compounds</li>
      <li>pure and impure substances</li>
      <li>chemical reactions</li>
      <li>energetics</li>
      <li>the periodic table</li>
      <li>materials</li>
      <li>earth and atmosphere</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Themes you'll cover when you teach 14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4) will be more specific to <%= @front_matter["subject"] %>, and include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>atomic structure and the periodic table</li>
      <li>structure, bonding and the properties of matter</li>
      <li>chemical changes</li>
      <li>energy changes in chemistry</li>
      <li>rate and extent of chemical change</li>
      <li>chemical analysis</li>
      <li>chemical and allied industries</li>
      <li>earth and atmospheric science</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At A level and AS level (key stage 5), youâ€™ll help pupils develop a deeper knowledge and understanding of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>formulae, equations and amounts of substance</li>
      <li>atomic structure</li>
      <li>bonding and structure</li>
      <li>energetics</li>
      <li>kinetics</li>
      <li>equilibria</li>
      <li>redox</li>
      <li>inorganic chemistry and the periodic table</li>
      <li>organic chemistry</li>
      <li>modern analytical techniques</li>
