      <p>Maths is critical to science, technology and engineering as well as being fundamental for most jobs.</p>
      <p>A good understanding of maths can help children develop life skills such as cooking, managing a budget and problem solving. It's also our government's goal for all young people to study maths to age 18.</p>
