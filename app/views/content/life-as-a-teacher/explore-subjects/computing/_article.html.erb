    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Why teach computing</h2>
    <p>You'll inspire pupils to access new fields and teach them transferable skills that will open lots of sectors, from engineering to healthcare, and could lead to careers such as software engineering and web design.</p>
    <p>Computing focuses on 3 areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>information and communication technology</li>
      <li>digital literacy</li>
      <li>computer science</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">What you'll teach</h2>
    <p>You'll teach the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study">national curriculum for computing</a>, with opportunities to develop your pupils' computational thinking.</p>
    <p>Themes you'll cover when you teach 11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3) include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>algorithms</li>
      <li>programming and debugging</li>
      <li>creative projects</li>
      <li>use of logical reasoning</li>
      <li>computer systems</li>
      <li>uses of technology</li>
      <li>online safety </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you're teaching key stage 3 you could use interactive exercises during your lessons, like creating a robot car.</p>
    <p>Explore what teaching a key stage 3 computing lesson would be like at the <a href="https://www.thenational.academy/teachers/programmes/computing-secondary-ks3-l/units">Oak National Academy website</a>.</p>
