    <h2 class="heading--box-blue">Why teach computing</h2>
    <p>You'll inspire pupils to access new fields and teach them transferable skills that will open lots of sectors, from engineering to healthcare, and could lead to careers such as software engineering and web design.</p>
    <p>Computing focuses on 3 areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>information and communication technology</li>
      <li>digital literacy</li>
      <li>computer science</li>
    </ul>
