      <p>Teaching drama opens the door for your pupils to pursue exciting careers in fields such as acting, stage management and set design.</p>
      <p>Your pupils will learn more from you than you might think. As their drama teacher, you'll guide them through the skills needed to write, rehearse and perform dramatic pieces. You'll teach them valuable life skills such as confidence with public speaking, working collaboratively and thinking creatively.</p>
