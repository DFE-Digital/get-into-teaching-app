    <div class="inset">
      <p>Through teaching history, you’ll challenge pupils to scrutinise evidence to build a picture of the past. Guiding them through the often elusive sources left to us, you'll help them question the reliability and accuracy of what they read. They’ll build skills in research, handling evidence, and forming persuasive arguments.</p>

  <h3>Teaching classics</h3>
  <p>If you have a passion for the ancient world, you could train as a classics teacher and inspire a new generation to uncover the timeless wonders of the ancient past.</p>
  <p>While there's no set national curriculum for classics, you're likely to teach a combination of ancient languages and history covering the period from around 3000 BCE to 500 CE.</p>
 <p>Entry requirements vary between providers. However, you'll typically need a degree in a related field and a strong foundation in an ancient language, such as an A level in Latin.</p>
 <p><a href="/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries">Tax-free bursaries of <%= v "bursaries_postgraduate_languagesother" %></a> may be available for trainee classics teachers when more than 50% of the course content covers an ancient language. Your course provider will confirm if this applies.</p>
