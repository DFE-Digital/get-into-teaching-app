Give yourself the best chance of getting on the course you want.

Discover tips on writing your application, finding referees and preparing for
interviews.

## Browse courses

You can [search for most postgraduate teacher training courses on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

You can apply to up to 3 courses in total, and then accept one offer.

Many people do not get in the first time, but there’s no need to wait until the
next year to apply again.

You can rework your application and apply to further courses one at a time.

train](/ways-to-train).

## Questions to ask your training provider

Every training provider and training programme is different.

Note down any questions that come to mind while browsing courses.

You may want to ask potential training providers questions, such as:

1. How are academic work and practical teaching arranged?
2. Who will my mentor be and how often will I meet with them?
3. Which schools and how many schools will I teach in?
4. Will I get any other qualifications aside from qualified teacher status
   (QTS), and what are the benefits of that?
5. Do you advise me to [get school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/)?
6. Will you support me to find my first teaching job?
7. How long does the training take?

## When to apply

Courses usually open for applications in October for entry the following year
(usually starting in September, but sometimes January).

Teacher training providers allocate places as people apply through the year,
and courses stay open until they are full.

If you’re keen to join a popular course it’s wise to apply as soon as you’re
ready rather than putting it off.

## What to expect: the application form

When you apply you’ll need to give details about:

* your qualifications, including your GCSEs and A levels (or equivalents) and degree
* your work history or unpaid experience
* why you want to teach
* why you’re suited to teach a particular subject or age group

You can also share whether you need any adjustments during the application
process or on the course - for example, if you’re disabled.

You’ll be encouraged to declare any potential safeguarding issues such as
criminal convictions. Training providers can advise you whether it’ll affect
your application.

## Prepare your application

You can [find and apply to most postgraduate teacher training courses on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses).

If you do not find what you were looking for, there are [other ways to train](/ways-to-train).

Before you start, it’s particularly important to think about your referees and
personal statement.

Some people do not get on the course they want because their application has
not convinced the admissions team that they’re right for it.

## Choose your referees

You need 2 references to apply.

Unlike a standard work reference, your references for teacher training need to
be named individuals rather than (for example) a human resources team or
academic department.

Your referees will be asked to write 500 words about your character and
suitability for teaching.

They’ll have 2 weeks to respond, so it’s worth contacting them before you apply
so they understand why you’re applying and what they’ll be asked to do.

Choose referees who’ll endorse your:

* teaching passion and potential
* suitability for working with children
* academic abilities
* reliability and professionalism

Ideal referees could include:

* your university tutor or supervisor
* your current line manager at work
* your previous employer
* a teacher at a school where you work or volunteer
* a supplier or client you’ve worked with (if you’re self-employed)

Referees should not be family members, partners or friends.

Training providers will only accept a character reference as a second reference.

It’s important to have at least one academic or professional reference.

If you’re applying for a salaried course, one of your references must be from
an employer.

## Your personal statement

Explaining why you want to be a teacher is an essential part of your application - so
it’s worth taking your time on it.

A personal statement is usually about 500 words. It’s your chance to show your
motivation, commitment and teaching potential.

You may want to cover some of the following:

* why you want to teach
* what inspired you to choose teaching
* your thoughts on children and young children’s wellbeing and the education system
* your understanding of the demands and rewards of the profession
* personal qualities that will make you a good teacher
* your contribution to the life of the school outside the classroom – for
  example, running extra-curricular activities and clubs
* details of any experience you have working with children and what you learnt
* your suitability to teach a subject or group
* evidence of the knowledge you have in your subject

## If you’re invited to interview

Interviews usually last a day and may include time spent teaching real pupils.

You can [get support preparing for an interview from an adviser](/tta-service).

Interviews vary from provider to provider – you’ll be given all the information
you need when you’re invited to attend.

Some providers are doing interviews online due to COVID-19 restrictions.

## If you get an offer

Congratulations!

Before you start your training the provider will check whether you’re safe to work
with children through an enhanced DBS check.

They’ll also check whether you’re fit to train to teach through a health questionnaire.

If you’re missing certain qualifications they may also ask you to do an
equivalence test or take a ‘subject knowledge enhancement’ course.

## If you do not get a place

Your provider will give you feedback to help you address any issues with your application.

You may need to get an additional qualification, improve your interview
technique or improve the quality of your application.

You can apply as many times as you want to get a place. Many people succeed
second or third time round.
