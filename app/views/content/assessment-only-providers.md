If you have a degree and enough classroom experience, you may be able to get qualified teacher status (QTS) through a 12-week assessment only (AO) programme.

The accredited teacher training providers listed on this page offer the AO programme. Contact them directly to ask them about entry criteria and to apply.

If you have experience of teaching outside the UK, some training providers will let you apply for an assessment only QTS without visiting or training in England.
