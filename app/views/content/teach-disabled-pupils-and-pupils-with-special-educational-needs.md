Most disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs learn in mainstream schools.

No matter what settings you train and work in – whether it's mainstream schools, special schools, or both – you’ll work with pupils with complex needs.

You can [find a course which specialises in special educational needs and disability (SEND)](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/start/subject?l=2) if you have a particular interest in this area.

However, it’s not essential to do a course specialising in SEND.

As you train and teach you'll get the skills you need to work with disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs.

This will enable you to work in a range of settings throughout your career.

## Teach pupils with sensory impairments

You need [specific qualifications to teach a class of pupils with hearing impairments, vision impairments or multi-sensory impairments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mandatory-qualifications-specialist-teachers).

## Become a special educational needs coordinator

A special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) assesses, plans and monitors the progress of disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs.

Once you’re a qualified teacher you'll need to complete the [National Award in Special Educational Needs Coordination (NASENCo)](https://nasen.org.uk/page/nasenco) when you take up your SENCO post.
