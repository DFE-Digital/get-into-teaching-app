One of the great benefits of a teaching career is a secure pension that will help you save for your future. 

The teachers’ pension scheme is one of the most generous in the country. These are some of the key benefits of the scheme.

## Easy to get started

As a teacher, you’ll be automatically enrolled at the start of your career, and remain in the scheme when moving teaching jobs, unless you opt out. 

Under the scheme, you'll automatically pay from your salary into your pension each month. At the same time, your employer also contributes.

Once you join the scheme, it's quick and easy to manage your pension online.

## Based on your salary

It’s a ‘defined benefit’ pension, which means that it’s based on your salary rather than the amount you contribute.

If your salary increases, the amount you and your employer pay will increase too. You can also choose to pay extra contributions if you want to. [Learn more about paying extra contributions on the teachers' pension scheme website](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/working-life/paying-in/increasing-your-pension/additional-pension.aspx).

## Tax-free saving

All of your contributions are tax-free, as the scheme is registered with HM Revenue and Customs.

It’s also one of only 8 schemes backed by the government. This means that it’s not reliant on pension money being invested elsewhere.

The scheme is flexible so you can convert part of your pension early as a tax-free lump sum. 

## Protection for your family

If you became ill during your career, you could apply for early ill-health retirement.

If you were to die while actively paying into your pension, a nominated beneficiary would receive a death grant. After 2 years of paying into your pension, a nominated beneficiary would also receive a pension after you die.
