You can visit schools to get experience in the classroom.

It can help you:

* observe lessons
* see how teachers manage a classroom
* find out how specific subjects are taught
* speak to teachers and interact with pupils
* learn more about teacher training - including the application and interview process

## Find school experience

Use our [Get school experience service](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/) to search for and request experience in England.

If you cannot find what you’re looking for, you can contact schools yourself. [Find schools near you](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) and give them a ring to find out who to talk to about getting school experience. They may ask you to have a DBS check before attending.
