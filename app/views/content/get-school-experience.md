School experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

Spending some time in a school allows you to:

* observe a range of lessons and other teacher responsibilities
* talk to teachers
* get an insight into day-to-day school life

To find school experience you can:

* [find a school offering experience through GOV.UK](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/)
* approach schools yourself

Many schools offer virtual experience. This could include talking to teachers and reviewing videos of lessons, for example.

## Approach schools yourself

[Find schools near you](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) and give them a ring to find out who to talk to about getting school experience.

It's normal to have to try a few schools before you find one that can help.

They may be limiting visitors due to coronavirus (COVID-19) and may need to organise a [DBS check](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

Be flexible with your availability if possible and persevere with your search.

## Maths or physics teaching internships

You may be eligible for a [maths or physics teaching internship earning £300 a week if you're doing a undergraduate degree in science, technology, engineering or maths](/teaching-internship-providers).

## If you cannot get into the classroom right now

[Observe teachers’ lessons and analysis of their lessons on the Oak National Academy website](https://teachers.thenational.academy/lessons-for-itt).

These videos are not a claim of best practice but can help you get to know teaching better.

[Events](/events) can also give you an insight into teaching.
