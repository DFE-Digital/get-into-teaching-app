This service is run by the Department for Education (DfE).

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the service using just a keyboard and speech recognition software
* listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) and [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/))

We've also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.

For advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability visit [AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/).

You can also find advice on GOV.UK at [Accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility).
