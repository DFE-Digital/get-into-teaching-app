This accessibility statement applies to the Get into Teaching website.

This website is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.

For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.1 AA standard, due to the following non-compliances:

* on the bursaries and scholarships page, the widget in the ‘What funding could I get for teacher training’ section is difficult for screen reader and keyboard users to navigate due to the way the page refreshes when the selection changes. In addition, the page title is re-announced for screen reader users. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.1 3.2.2 On Input (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input.html)

* the hover state of our 'Set cookie preferences' button on our cookie modal, the ‘How to become a teacher’ block on the home page, the 'Get free one-to-one support' block on the how to become a teacher page and the 'Find out more about getting into teaching' block on the how to become a teacher landing page all have insufficient colour contrast ratios for non-text elements. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.1 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We are currently working to address the known accessibility issues.

We’ll continue to test the accessibility of this service as it develops.
