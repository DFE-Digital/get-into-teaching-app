This accessibility statement applies to the Get into Teaching website.

This website is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.

For example, that means you should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

The [AbilityNet website](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.2 AA standard, due to the following non-compliances.

### Non-accessible content

The content is non-accessible for the following reasons:

* some of the non-verbal information presented in videos on the site is not included in audio descriptions. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.2 AA - 1.2.5 Audio Description (prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-description-prerecorded)
* the visual styling of the results displayed in our search function does not match the programmatic information which could cause problems for screen reader users. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.2 A - 1.3.1 Info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships)
* in our main navigational menu, there is an issue with the programmatic reading order, with some sub-menu items appearing last which may be confusing for users. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.2 A - 1.3.2 Meaningful sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/meaningful-sequence)
* on the [events page](/events), the [bursaries and scholarship page](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) and in the welcome guide, some content is cut off the screen at 400% zoom. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.2 AA - 1.4.10 Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow)

#### Webchat

The webchat content is non-accessible for the following reasons:

* on the Tell us about yourself page, the error message is not programmatically associated with the field and is not announced by screen readers when tabbing onto the field itself. This fails to meet [WCAG 2.2 A - 1.3.1 Info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships)

## What we're doing to improve accessibility

We are currently working to address the known accessibility issues.

We’ll continue to test the accessibility of this service as it develops.
