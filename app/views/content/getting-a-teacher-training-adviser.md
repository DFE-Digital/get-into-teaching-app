### What an adviser can do for you

Trainee teachers say they've particularly valued help with: 

* School experience
* Financial support
* Personal statements
* Interview preparation

### What you'll need

To sign up, you'll need one of these:

* Bachelor's degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
* Predicted grade 2:2 or higher for your bachelor's degree with honours, if you're still a student
* Overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor's degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher

Not sure how your qualification compares? An adviser can help with that.
