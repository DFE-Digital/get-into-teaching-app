You’ll be known as an early career teacher (ECT) for your first 2 years in teaching. The term early career teacher (ECT) has replaced newly qualified teacher (NQT).

During your 2 year induction, you’ll receive a package of training and support based on the [early career framework (ECF)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-the-early-career-framework-ecf-supports-induction). This is designed to help you build the skills and knowledge you need to feel confident and empowered in your classroom.

This won’t impact your pay or progression opportunities. You’ll still be able to progress on the pay scale during your induction period.

## ECF-based training

You’ll receive training based on the early career framework (ECF) as part of your induction period. This is called ECF-based training.

ECF-based training provides a bridge between your initial teacher training (ITT) and your teaching career. Your ITT helps you qualify as a teacher, and the ECF-based training helps you further develop your teaching practice and working habits.

### Your training programme

Your school will choose how to deliver your training based on the early career framework (ECF). They may:

* use a Department for Education (DfE) funded training provider
* use DfE accredited materials
* design and deliver their own training

This could be through face to face learning or using online materials.

You’ll also observe experienced teachers to help you develop your own good practice.

## Your mentor

You’ll be given a mentor during your induction period.

Your mentor will:

* provide one to one support and feedback
* work with your school to make sure you’re receiving a high quality induction programme
* provide or arrange mentoring and coaching around specific subject areas
* take prompt, appropriate action if you’re having difficulties

## Paid time away from classroom teaching

In your first year of teaching, you’ll have a 10% timetable reduction. In your second year of teaching, you’ll have a 5% timetable reduction. This means a reduced teaching schedule to give you time away from the classroom to focus on your learning and development. 

This is in addition to the time allocated for planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) that all teachers get.

## Meeting the teachers’ standards

You’ll have to show you meet the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) through your induction period. You’ll need to pass your induction period to continue to work as a qualified teacher in a state maintained school in England.

### Your induction tutor

You’ll have an induction tutor at your school who’ll assess you against the teachers’ standards. Usually, your induction tutor will be different from your mentor but this may depend on your school’s capacity to fill the 2 roles.

You’ll have regular progress reviews with your induction tutor so that you can discuss your progress and feedback.

### How you'll be assessed

You’ll have 2 formal assessment meetings with your induction tutor — one midway through induction and one at the end.

They may ask you for evidence that you’ve met the teachers’ standards. You won’t need to create anything new for this evidence — you should use existing lesson plans or feedback from observations.
