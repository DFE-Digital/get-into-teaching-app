      If you have a degree, you can do postgraduate teacher training to get qualified teacher status (QTS) – this is what you need to teach in many primary, secondary and special schools in England.

      <p>
      Courses take 9 months full-time or 18 to 24 months part-time. They usually start in September. Your training will include time spent in at least 2 schools to get classroom experience, as well as some academic learning.

      The thought of teaching your own class might seem daunting. If your teacher training course leads to qualified teacher status (QTS) you get a whole package of training and support as an early career teacher, so you’re not thrown in at the deep end. This includes regular catch ups with a mentor to guide you through any challenges you might have.

      If you already have at least 2 years' experience as an unqualified teacher, you might not have to do any further training.

      <p>
      Instead, you could be eligible for the assessment only route to QTS which can take up to 12 weeks.
