      If you have a degree, you can do postgraduate teacher training to get qualified teacher status (QTS) â€“ this is what you need to teach in many primary, secondary and special schools in England.

      <p>
      Full-time courses take 9 months full-time, and 18 to 24 part-time, usually starting in September. Your training will include time spent in at least 2 schools to get classroom experience, as well as some academic learning.
