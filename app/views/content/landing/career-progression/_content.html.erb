      If you have a degree, you can do postgraduate teacher training to get qualified teacher status (QTS) â€“ this is what you need to teach in many primary, secondary and special schools in England.
      </p>

      <p>
      Courses take 9 months full-time or 18 to 24 months part-time. They usually start in September. Your training will include time spent in at least 2 schools to get classroom experience, as well as some academic learning.

      Teaching is a career that encourages continuous growth, both personally and professionally. Not only can you make a difference to the lives of the students you teach, you can make a difference to your own. 
      </p>

      <p>
      This includes regular catch ups with a mentor to guide you through any challenges you might have.
