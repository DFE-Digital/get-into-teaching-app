A PGCE is a teaching qualification. It stands for ‘postgraduate certificate in education’. 

The course you take to get a PGCE is a mixture of learning education theory, and being placed in a school classroom to learn from experience.

A similar course is a PGDE, or ‘post graduate diploma in education’. A PGDE course is very similar to a PGCE, the difference being the amount of academic credits you are awarded at the end of your course. 

If you want to teach in a state school in England, you will also need to get ‘qualified teacher status’ (QTS) alongside your PGCE or PGDE course.
