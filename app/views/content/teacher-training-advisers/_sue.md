With a degree and 20 years’ worth of professional experience, Sue decided she wanted to use her passion for geography to inspire young people about the natural world. The move was made even easier by her adviser, who was able to tailor advice and support to Sue’s circumstances.

“I found it most helpful to have each step of the teacher training process explained to me, as this helped me to identify what I needed to do at each stage. There’s also quite a lot of confusing terminology used around teaching and my adviser helped me get to grips with this. Additionally, the constructive feedback I received was especially useful, especially for my personal statement.”

“The support is tailored to your needs rather than being a generic ‘one size fits all’ approach. There were some parts of the support that I didn’t need and others that I definitely did.”

"I was supported throughout the application process – specifically for me I was provided support with my personal statement, interviews and with the skills tests. Importantly, my adviser helped with arranging my school experience to support my application," says the now geography trainee.

There’s a peace of mind that comes with knowing there’s someone you can ring or email. Without the Teacher Training Adviser service, I wouldn’t have pursued my application. I would recommend you should take the plunge, take the support on offer and get going!

With your own dedicated and highly experienced adviser, you’ll receive a programme of free support at each stage of the application process. Your teacher training adviser will help you maximise your chance of submitting a successful application and help you smoothly transition into your exciting new career.
