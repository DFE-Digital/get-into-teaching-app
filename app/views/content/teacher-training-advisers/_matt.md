After 25 years in industry, Matt wanted to switch careers and do something where he could really make a difference. He enjoyed helping his daughter with her maths homework, but didn't know where to start. By chatting through his options with his teacher training adviser, he was able to navigate his way into an exciting new career.

“The Teacher Training Adviser service is an essential advisory programme which answers all the questions that a potential trainee may need assistance with at every stage of moving into teaching. It’s also free, so don’t think twice about using this service.” 

“I wouldn’t have known where to go or what to do without my adviser, Simon. He took me through the requirements of my teacher training application. Additionally, I received significant advice on the two routes into teaching and the tax-free bursaries. Importantly, I was provided with advice on my personal statement where you have to write about why you want to become a teacher."

“The advice provided was invaluable. The service took my application from good to excellent."
