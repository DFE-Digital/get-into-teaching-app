          text: "I like to be organised, so I always had my diary with a notebook in the back with me. I’d got into a bad habit of writing notes in random notebooks and not always knowing where those notes were. I’d end up never using them so I gave myself one book. I still do it now and have one big academic planner with my notes in the back.",

          text: "In lectures, I felt like I had to write everything down. A lecturer told me once, why don’t you just sit there and listen? Then when you go home, do the reading, and get down what you need. That made my life a thousand times easier and it’s something I make sure my students do now.",

          text: "Be creative in how you learn but don’t reinvent the wheel. Degrees are a different level of intensity, but the framework is the same as A-levels or BTECs. Whatever got you here will continue to work! Consistency and intentionality will trump any overnight success - and that’s the same in whatever stage in life.",
