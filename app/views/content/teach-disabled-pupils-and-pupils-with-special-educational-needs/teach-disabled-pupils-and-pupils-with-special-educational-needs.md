Most disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs learn in mainstream schools.

As a qualified teacher you’ll have the opportunity to work with pupils with complex needs, no matter what setting you work in.

Once you’ve got [qualified teacher status](/ways-to-train) you might choose to teach in a mainstream or a special school, for example.

You can [find a course which specialises in special educational needs and disability (SEND)](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/start/subject?l=2) if you have a particular interest in this area. However, it’s not essential.

## Teach pupils with sensory impairments

You need [specific qualifications to teach a class of pupils with hearing impairments, vision impairments or multi-sensory impairments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mandatory-qualifications-specialist-teachers).

## Become a special educational needs coordinator

A special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) assesses, plans and monitors the progress of disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs.

Once you’re a qualified teacher you'll need to complete the [National Award in Special Educational Needs Coordination (NASENCo)](https://nasen.org.uk/page/nasenco) when you take up your SENCO post.
