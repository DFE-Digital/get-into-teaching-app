## If you're a current trainee

[Visit GOV.UK for information about the government response to coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus).

Contact your provider if you have any questions about how coronavirus is affecting your course.

## If you're an applicant: your questions answered

### Can I get school experience?

Although it's not an entry requirement for initial teacher training (ITT), getting classroom experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

Some schools are offering school experience both in school and virtually.

Sign up to [get school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/).

### How long do teacher training providers have to make a decision on my application?

40 days.

### Do I have to have a face-to-face interview?

There is no requirement for a face-to-face interview. Your interview may take place online.

You may be asked to send your degree or GCSE certificates digitally too.

Wait for your provider to contact you with more information.

### I am doing a GCSE to be eligible to start training but exams have been cancelled. What should I do?

Details on assessment for GCSEs in summer 2021 are due to be confirmed after consultation in the spring term.

Speak to your training provider to discuss your situation.

### Are Train To Teach events going ahead?

[Spring events have now been confirmed](/events).

### What if I’m an overseas applicant?

Although global travel, including to the UK, is affected by coronavirus, we still encourage you to take steps to become a teacher in England.

Check your country’s advice as well as the UK's advice to keep up to date with travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements.

The UK government has also published guidance about [what to do if you need a visa to travel to the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents#outside-uk) and has a coronavirus immigration [help centre](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents#helpline).

Further information is available if you are affected by [changes to UK immigration and borders due to coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-immigration-and-borders).

### How do I ask a question?

[Get in touch if you have a question not covered on this page](#talk-to-us).

## If you're an initial teacher training provider

See the government's [guidance for schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak#school-workforce).

We have been working closely across government to [develop guidance to support initial teacher training providers during this time](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-initial-teacher-training-itt).

You can also find [amended ITT criteria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria) and guidance on [assessing for QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-initial-teacher-training-itt/coronavirus-covid-19-initial-teacher-training-itt#recommendation-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts--progress-assessments-for-202021-trainees).
