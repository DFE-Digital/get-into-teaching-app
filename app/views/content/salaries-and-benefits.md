Schools develop their own pay policies to attract and retain teachers that have the greatest impact on their pupils' learning. What you're paid will be linked to performance, not length of service - meaning your salary can move forward in line with your career.

## Qualified teachers

As a newly qualified teacher you could earn between £25,714 and £32,157 depending on where you teach.

As you progress in your teaching career, it's possible to move up through these pay ranges:

| Area                          | Minimum | Maximum |
| -------                       | -----   | -----   |
| Inner London                  | £32,157 | £50,953 |
| Outer London                  | £29,915 | £45,766 |
| London fringe                 | £26,948 | £42,780 |
| The rest of England and Wales | £25,714 | £41,604 |

### Newly qualified teacher benefits
 
A new 2-year package to support teachers at the start of their career, based on the [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers), launches nationally in September 2021.
 
The support package includes:
 
* funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
* a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the Early Career Framework
* funded training for mentors of early career teachers
* funded time for mentors to support early career teachers 

### Teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) payments

If you take on extra ongoing responsibilities in your role, you could get a salary uplift.

There are two main ranges for these (TLR 1 and TLR 2), depending on the category your duties come under:

| Level   | Minimum | Maximum |
| ------- | -----   | -----   |
| TLR 1   | £8,291  | £14,030 |
| TLR 2   | £2,873  | £7,017  |

Factors that apply to awarding TLRs include impact on educational progress beyond the teacher’s assigned pupils. It may also involve leading, developing and enhancing the teaching practice of others.

### Holidays

You'll get more days than people in many other professions. Full-time teachers work for 195 days per year in school.

### Teachers’ Pension Scheme

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme gives you a regular source of income when you retire. It is:

* based on your salary and service rather than investments
* registered with HM Revenue and Customs - so your contributions are tax-free
* flexible and allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum
