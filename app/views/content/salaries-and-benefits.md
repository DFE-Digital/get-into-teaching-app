For helping to shape the next generation you’re entitled to a competitive salary, generous holidays, and a substantial pension.

Figures are for teachers in the 2022/23 academic year.

## Teaching salaries

All recently qualified teachers will have a starting salary of at least £28,000. This will be higher for teachers working in and around London.

Your school will have their own pay scales for qualified teachers. Pay increases will always be linked to performance, not length of service.

Annual teacher pay scales for qualified teachers are:

| Area                                     | Minimum | Maximum |
| -------                                  | -----   | -----   |
| England and Wales (excluding London)     | £28,000 | £38,810 |
| Inner London                             | £34,502 | £44,756 |
| Outer London                             | £32,407 | £43,193 |
| Fringe of London                         | £29,344 | £40,083 |

Most established teachers will earn more than this by progressing onto the upper pay range for teachers, or by becoming a leading practitioner.

If you’re not sure whether your school is in inner, outer or the fringe of London, talk to your school.

## Holidays

You'll get more days holiday than people in many other professions. In school, full-time teachers work 195 days per year. 

For comparison, you'd work 227 days per year (on average) if you worked full time in an office.

## Teachers' pension scheme

The teachers’ pension scheme is one of the most generous in the country. It is a 'defined benefit' pension and is:

* based on your teaching salary rather than the amount of money you pay in
* registered with HM Revenue and Customs - so your contributions are tax-free
* flexible and allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum

You also get other insurance benefits too. You can find out more on [the teachers' pension scheme website](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/new-starter.aspx).

## Support for early career teachers

All teachers are given extra support during their first 2 years in teaching called [ECF-based training](/support-for-early-career-teachers). This helps early career teachers (ECTs) develop their knowledge, teaching skills and working habits.

This support includes:

* paid time away from classroom teaching to focus on your development
* a high quality training programme based on the [early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework)
* a mentor who will give you guidance and support

The term early career teacher (ECT) replaced newly qualified teacher (NQT).

## Career progression

There are different ways to progress and increase your teaching salary.

For example, you can move into a more senior role, or take on additional responsibilities that help your school.

### Upper pay range for teachers

If you take on extra responsibilities, like being a head of department, you can be put onto a higher teacher pay scale.

Teachers in this pay scale are important members of a school’s leadership team, and they often work closely with headteachers.

The upper pay ranges for teachers are:

| Area                                     | Minimum | Maximum |
| -------                                  | -----   | -----   |
| England and Wales (excluding London)     | £40,625 | £43,685 |
| Inner London                             | £49,320 | £53,482 |
| Outer London                             | £44,687 | £48,055 |
| Fringe of London                         | £41,858 | £44,919 |

### Leading practitioner salaries

If you’re an established and exceptional teacher, and regularly show the highest standards of classroom teaching, you can be put onto a higher pay scale.

Although they may not lead departments, leading practitioners coach and mentor other teachers and induct trainees and early career teachers (ECTs).

The teacher pay scales for leading practitioners are:

| Area                                     | Minimum | Maximum |
| -------                                  | -----   | -----   |
| England and Wales (excluding London)     | £44,523 | £67,685 |
| Inner London                             | £52,936 | £76,104 |
| Outer London                             | £48,055 | £71,220 |
| Fringe of London                         | £45,749 | £68,913 |


### Headteacher salaries

A headteacher is the most senior person in a school. They are ultimately responsible for all teachers and pupils. 

Their role is wide ranging, but includes leading and motivating teachers, and ensuring all pupils get a good education.

Annual salary ranges for headteachers are:

| Area                                     | Minimum | Maximum  |
| -------                                  | -----   | -----    |
| England and Wales (excluding London)     | £50,122 | £123,057 |
| Inner London                             | £58,501 | £131,353 |
| Outer London                             | £53,637 | £126,539 |
| Fringe of London                         | £51,347 | £124,274 |

### Other payments

You might also get extra payments for taking on extra responsibilities.

These payments are called ‘teaching and learning responsibility’ (TLR) payments. The extra responsibilities you might take on are:

* progressing the education of people beyond your assigned pupils
* leading, developing and enhancing the teaching practice of others
* TLR payments come in 2 main pay ranges (TLR 1 and TLR 2) depending on your responsibilities.

| Level         | Minimum | Maximum|
| -------       | -----   | -----  |
| TLR 1         | £8,706  | £14,732|
| TLR 2         | £3,017  | £7,368 |

### Unqualified teacher salaries

Many schools in England require teachers to have 'qualified teacher status' (QTS). If you do not have this, you can work
in some schools as an unqualified teacher.

Annual unqualified teacher salary ranges are:

| Area                                     | Minimum | Maximum |
| -------                                  | -----   | -----   |
| England and Wales (excluding London)     | £19,340 | £30,172 |
| Inner London                             | £24,254 | £35,081 |
| Outer London                             | £22,924 | £33,759 |
| Fringe of London                         | £20,594 | 31,421  |
