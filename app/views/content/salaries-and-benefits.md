Schools develop their own pay scales to attract and retain teachers that have the greatest impact on their pupils' learning.

What you're paid will be linked to performance, not length of service - meaning your salary can increase as you go through your career.

## Qualified teachers

As a newly qualified teacher (NQT) in a primary or secondary school your starting salary will be between £25,714 and £32,157 depending on where you teach.

As you progress in your teaching career, it's possible to move up through these pay scales:

| Area                          | Minimum | Maximum |
| -------                       | -----   | -----   |
| Inner London                  | £32,157 | £50,953 |
| Outer London                  | £29,915 | £45,766 |
| London fringe                 | £26,948 | £42,780 |
| The rest of England and Wales | £25,714 | £41,604 |

### Holidays

You'll get more days than people in many other professions. Full-time teachers work for 195 days per year in school.

### Newly qualified teacher (NQT) benefits

A 2-year package to support teachers at the start of their career, based on the [early career framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers), launches nationally in September 2021.

The support package includes:

* funded 5% time off timetable in the second year of teaching, in addition to the existing 10% in the first year
* a range of high-quality, freely available curricula and training materials underpinned by the early career framework
* funded training for mentors of early career teachers
* funded time for mentors to support early career teachers

### Get a salary uplift for taking on extra responsibilities

You may be able to get 'teaching and learning responsibility' (TLR) payments if you take on extra responsibilities such as:

* progressing the education of people beyond your assigned pupils
* leading, developing and enhancing the teaching practice of others

TLR payments come in 2 main pay ranges (TLR 1 and TLR 2) depending on your responsibilities. For example, the higher payment involves taking on line management responsibilities.

| Level   | Minimum | Maximum |
| ------- | -----   | -----   |
| TLR 1   | £8,291  | £14,030 |
| TLR 2   | £2,873  | £7,017  |

### Teachers’ Pension Scheme

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme gives you a regular source of income when you retire. It is:

* based on your teaching salary and service rather than investments
* registered with HM Revenue and Customs - so your contributions are tax-free
* flexible and allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum
