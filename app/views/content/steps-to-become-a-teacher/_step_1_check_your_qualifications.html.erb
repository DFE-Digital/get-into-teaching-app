<p>To train to teach, you’ll need to have GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary).</p>

<p>You also need a degree in any subject to teach primary and secondary – if you have one or an equivalent qualification, you can do postgraduate teacher training.</p>

<p>If you do not have a degree, you can do undergraduate teacher training to get a degree alongside qualified teacher status (QTS). Or you may be eligible to do a <a href=" https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2024/02/04/teacher-degree-apprenticeships-how-they-work-and-when-to-apply/"> Teacher Degree Apprenticeship (TDA)</a> and work in a school, earning a salary while getting a batchelor’s degree and QTS.</p>

<p>Applications for the new TDAs are expected to launch in autumn 2024 for both primary and secondary and training is due to start in autumn 2025.</p>
