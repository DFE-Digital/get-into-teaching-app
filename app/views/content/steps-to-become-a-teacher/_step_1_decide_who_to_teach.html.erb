<p><a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/">Get school experience</a> or <a href="/events">attend events</a> to see which of the following age groups suits you best:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary (ages 5 to 11)</li>
  <li>secondary (ages 11 to 18)</li>
  <li>children up to the age of 5 - <a href="/early-years-teaching-training">become an early years teacher</a></li>
  <li>people aged 14 and above - <a href="/further-education-teacher-training">become a further education teacher</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps if you want to teach primary or secondary, including if you want to teach disabled students or students with special educational needs in these settings.<p>
