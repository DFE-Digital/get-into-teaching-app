Are you a UK-trained teacher and UK citizen currently working abroad? Our
children and young people need your international skills, experience and
perspective.

If you're thinking about coming home to teach, we want to help.

If you are a non-UK citizen interested in teaching or training to teach in
England, please read our
[guidance for international teachers and trainees](/international-candidates)
to learn how we can support your journey to the UK.
