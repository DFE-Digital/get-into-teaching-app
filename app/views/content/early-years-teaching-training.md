The early years are critical in children’s development. As an early years teacher you’ll work with young children up to the age of 5. You’ll use your knowledge and skills to help young children enjoy high standards of teaching and open their minds to new ideas every day.

You’ll need to do early years initial teacher training (EYITT) to achieve early years teacher status (EYTS). This will allow you to work in a nursery or early years setting. 

If you want to teach in a primary school, including in a reception class, or secondary school then you will need to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS). [Find out more about training to teach primary and secondary pupils](/train-to-be-a-teacher).

## What you need to become an early years teacher

There are 2 ways to train to become an early years teacher, either as a postgraduate if you already have a degree, or as part of an undergraduate degree. 

To do postgraduate training, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree or an equivalent, for example, a vocational, professional, or overseas qualification.

To start early years teacher training, you’ll need these GCSE qualifications (or a vocational, professional, or overseas qualification to the same standard):

* maths grade 4 (C)
* English grade 4 (C)
* science grade 4 (C)
