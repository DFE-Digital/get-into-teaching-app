The early years are critical in children’s development. As an early years teacher you’ll work with young children up to the age of 5. You’ll use your knowledge and skills to help young children enjoy high standards of teaching and open their minds to new ideas every day.

You’ll need to do ‘early years initial teacher training’ (EYITT) to achieve ‘early years teacher status’ (EYTS). This will allow you to work in a nursery or early years setting. 

If you want to teach in a school then you will need to achieve qualified teacher status (QTS). You can learn more about this in our [train to be a teacher section](/train-to-be-a-teacher).

## What you need to become an early years teacher

If you do postgraduate early years teacher training, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree or an equivalent including vocational, professional, and overseas qualifications.

To start early years teacher training, you’ll need these qualifications (or to demonstrate an equivalent standard):

* maths grade 4 (C)
* English grade 4 (C)
* science grade 4 (C)
