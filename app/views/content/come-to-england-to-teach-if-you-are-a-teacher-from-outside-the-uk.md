Teach in England and you’ll benefit from working in a world-class education system.

You’ll earn a [competitive salary](/salaries-and-benefits), get supported in your professional development and have varied job opportunities.

You could also consider teaching in [Wales](https://educators.wales), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).

Not qualified as a teacher yet? Find out [how to train to teach in England as an international applicant](/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student). If you don't want to come to England to train, but would like to gain a professional teaching qualification which is equivalent to English qualified teacher status, you should consider [international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](/international-qualified-teacher-status).

### What you need to start teaching

To teach in England you need:

* teaching skills and experience
* to pass criminal and professional safeguarding checks (these will be organised by your employer)
* to [get the right visa or status](#get-the-right-visa-or-status)

It is also helpful to have a teaching qualification from your own or another non-UK country, or to get '[qualified teacher status](#consider-getting-qualified-teacher-status)'.

### Get the right visa or status

You'll need to [get the right visa or status to work in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk#visas-and-immigration).

Many teaching job offers allow you to apply for a ‘skilled worker visa’. You may also be eligible for another type of visa.

Alternatively, you may have a pre-existing right to work in the UK, such as settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) or [indefinite leave to remain in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk).

[If you're an Irish citizen you do not need a visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance).

### Consider getting qualified teacher status

[You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to teach in many schools in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualified-teacher-status-routes-to-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk).

It's not a requirement in all [types of schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school), such as academy schools, free schools, private schools and independent schools. However, having QTS can help your application.

If you’re a qualified teacher from outside the UK you can [work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without QTS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-teachers-from-overseas#employing-overseas-teachers-without-qts-the-4-year-rule).

[Apply for QTS if you trained outside the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualified-teacher-status-routes-to-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk).
