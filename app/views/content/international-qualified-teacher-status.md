## Introducing iQTS

International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a new teaching qualification backed by England’s Department for Education (DfE). iQTS meets the same high standards as [English qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) (QTS), and leads to the automatic award of QTS. You can train where you live and work, with no need to visit the UK. 

## Learn who iQTS is for
