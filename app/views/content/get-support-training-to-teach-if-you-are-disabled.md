The experience and perspective of a diverse workforce is valued in school culture.

If you’re disabled, have a mental health condition or educational needs, you can get support to become a teacher.

## Adjustments can help you train

Teacher training providers can make adjustments so that you can attend an interview or do the [training](/ways-to-train). For example, they could:

* organise equipment like a hearing loop or an adapted keyboard
* put you in touch with support staff if you have a mental health condition
* make sure classrooms are wheelchair accessible

Sharing that you're disabled when you [apply for teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training) can help providers make adjustments.

## Your rights

Providers must not discriminate against you. They cannot:

* ask disability or health questions if they’re not relevant to your ability to become a teacher
* reject your application because you’re disabled

Anyone who’s offered a place on a teacher training course is asked to complete a fitness questionnaire before starting training.

Training providers should only ask relevant questions to make sure you’re able to teach.

## Other support

You may be able to [get support if you’re a student and you’re disabled, have a learning difficulty or health problem](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa).

[If you do paid training you may also be eligible for support](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work).

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/about-abilitynet) or [Disability Rights UK](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/adjustments-disabled-students) may also be able to help you identify technology or other adjustments to help you study.
