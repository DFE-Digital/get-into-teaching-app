## Attend an event

Our events are a great way to meet teachers and other experts to talk about any concerns or questions you have about becoming a teacher.

### Train to Teach events

Train to Teach events are run by the Department for Education (DfE) and are free to attend. You'll be able to:

### Online question and answer sessions

There are online, text-based sessions where you can ask a panel of specialists the questions that matter to you. These sessions, run by DfE, cover a range of different topics so you can post specific questions and receive advice tailored to your particular circumstances.

### Training provider events

You could also attend a training provider event, either online or in person, and hear directly from teacher training providers about the courses they offer and how to apply.
