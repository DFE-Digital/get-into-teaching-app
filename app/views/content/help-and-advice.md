Our events are a great way to meet teachers and other experts to talk about any concerns or questions you have about becoming a teacher.

### Online question and answer sessions

There are online, text-based sessions where you can ask a panel of specialists the questions that matter to you. These sessions, run by DfE, cover a range of different topics so you can post specific questions and receive advice tailored to your particular circumstances.
