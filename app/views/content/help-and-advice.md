## Attend an event

Our events are a great way to meet teachers and other experts to talk about any concerns or questions you have about becoming a teacher.

### Train to Teach events

Train to Teach events are run by the Department for Education (DfE) and are free to attend. You'll be able to:

- put your questions to expert advisers, teachers and training providers
- chat with current teachers
- find out what a career in teaching is really like
- watch presentations which provide detailed guidance on how to get into teaching, the application process and funding your training

### Online question and answer sessions

There are online, text-based sessions where you can ask a panel of specialists the questions that matter to you. These sessions, run by DfE, cover a range of different topics so you can post specific questions and receive advice tailored to your particular circumstances.

### School and university events

You could also attend one of the School and University events, either online or in person, and hear directly from teacher training providers about the courses they offer and how to apply.
