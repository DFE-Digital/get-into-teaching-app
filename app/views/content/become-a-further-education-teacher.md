Further education is any study that takes place after secondary school but outside of higher education (e.g. university).

In further education, teaching doesnâ€™t always happen in a classroom. It can take place in community centres, workplaces and private training centres. 

You could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people and adults.

You do not need a degree to start teaching in further education.
