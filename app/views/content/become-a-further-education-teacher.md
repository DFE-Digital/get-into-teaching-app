Further education is any study that takes place after secondary school but outside of higher education (e.g. university).

In further education, teaching doesn’t always happen in a classroom. It can take place in community centres, workplaces and private training centres. 

You could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people and adults. 


## What you can teach

Courses range from basic literacy and numeracy to apprenticeships and technical qualifications. 

[Searching for further education jobs](https://www.aocjobs.com/jobs) will give you an idea of the subjects you can teach. Full-time, part-time and flexible contracts are available. 

Your local college or learning centre will be able to tell you about available jobs too.


## Using your professional experience

Your professional experience counts. You can use it to show employers that you are an expert when you apply.

Employers will often accept work experience in place of qualifications. 

You don't always need to have a degree, but you often need at least a [level 3 qualification](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels).


## Training to teach in further education

Some employers will let you start teaching without a qualification because you can work towards one as you go. This also means you'll be earning a salary straight away.

As part of your training, you might need to get a [qualification to teach in further education](https://www.feadvice.org.uk/i-want-work-fe-skills-sector/i-want-be-teacher-fe-skills/teaching-qualifications-fe-skills-sector). The type you need will depend on your employer.
