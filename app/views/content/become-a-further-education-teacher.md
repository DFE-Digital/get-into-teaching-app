title: Become a further education teacher.
---
Further education is any study that takes place after secondary school but outside of higher education (e.g. university).

Teaching in further education doesnâ€™t always happen in a classroom. It can take place in community centres, private training centres and workplaces. 


## What you can teach

Courses range from basic literacy and numeracy to apprenticeships and technical qualifications. 

Searching for further education jobs will give you an idea of the subjects you can teach.

## Using your professional experience

Your professional experience counts. You can use it to show employers that you are an expert when you apply.

Employers will often accept work experience in place of qualifications.


## Training to teach in further education

As part of your training, you will need to get a qualification to teach in further education. The type you need will depend on your employer.
 
Some employers will let you start teaching without a qualification because you can work towards one as you go.
