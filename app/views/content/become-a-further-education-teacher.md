If you’re interested in teaching young people and adults over 16 who are not studying for a degree, then further education might be for you. 

## What is further education?

It covers 3 key areas: 

* vocational courses including plumbing, manufacturing and health care
* academic classroom-based learning of subjects including English and maths, including A levels in a sixth form college
* basic skills courses on literacy, numeracy, English for speakers of other languages, and special needs

Whichever route you choose, you could teach a diverse set of learners.

## What qualifications do you need to teach in further education?

You do not always need a prior teaching qualification or an academic degree to start teaching in further education. 

Many further education training providers offer funded teacher training on the job, so you can start immediately. 

To find out more, visit the [teach in further education website](https://www.teach-in-further-education.campaign.gov.uk/).

However, if you’re mainly interested in teaching in a school, explore [how to train to teach primary and secondary pupils](/train-to-be-a-teacher).
