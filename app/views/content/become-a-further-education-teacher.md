If you’re interested in teaching young people and adults over 16 who aren’t studying for a degree, then further education might be for you. It covers three key areas: 

* vocational courses including plumbing, manufacturing and health care
* academic classroom based learning of subjects including English and maths, including A-levels in a sixth form college
* basic skills courses on literacy, numeracy, English for speakers of other languages, and special needs

Whichever route you choose, you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people and adults. 

You don’t always need a prior teaching qualification or an academic degree to start teaching in further education. Many further education training providers offer funded teacher training on the job, so you can start straight away. However, if you’re mainly interested in teaching in a school, you will be best to explore how to train to teach primary and secondary pupils.

Further education training providers are independent, so set their own criteria regarding qualifications and courses. If you’ve got industry experience and a passion for sharing your skills you could be a great further education teacher.
