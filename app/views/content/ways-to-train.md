You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

Not looking to teach in primary or secondary settings? Consider [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/further-education-teacher-training).

## How to get qualified teacher status

### If you have a degree

You can:

* [go back to university as a postgraduate student](#go-back-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student)
* [train as you teach at a school or group of schools](#_ks4us698kqkh)

You may even be able to [earn a salary](#earn-a-salary).

### If you do not have a degree

You can do [undergraduate teacher training](#undergraduate-teacher-training).

### If you already have teaching experience

You may be able to get qualified teacher status within 12 weeks [if you have teaching experience](#if-you-already-have-teaching-experience-1).

### Specialised training programmes

[If you're changing careers](#if-youre-changing-career) or [if you have a doctorate](#if-you-have-a-doctorate).

### Go back to university as a postgraduate student

With [university-led training](#compare-popular-types-of-postgraduate-primary-and-secondary-teacher-training) you spend about a third of your time in academic learning and the rest in school placements.

You'll get a PGCE or PGDE in addition to QTS by the end of your training.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can get [funding that you do not have to pay back](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects. You can also apply for a [student loan](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans).

### Train as you teach at a school or group of schools

On a '[school direct (fee-funded)](#compare-popular-types-of-postgraduate-primary-and-secondary-teacher-training)' programme you spend less time in academic learning than you would on a university course.

Many courses give you a PGCE or PGDE in addition to QTS.
