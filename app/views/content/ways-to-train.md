You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

Find out how to get qualified teacher status if you:

* [have a degree](#if-you-have-a-degree)
* [do not have a degree](#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree)
* [already have teaching experience](#if-you-already-have-teaching-experience)

You can also find specialised training programmes if you're:

* [changing careers](#if-youre-changing-career)
* [have a doctorate](#if-you-have-a-doctorate)

Not looking to teach in primary or secondary settings? Consider [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/further-education-teacher-training).

## If you have a degree

### Go back to university as a postgraduate student

With university-led training you spend about a third of your time in academic learning and the rest in school placements.

You'll get a PGCE or PGDE in addition to QTS by the end of your training.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects
* apply for a [student loan](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans)

### Train as you teach at a school or group of schools

On a 'school direct (fee-funded)' programme you spend less time in academic learning than you would on a university course.

Many courses give you a PGCE or PGDE in addition to QTS.

Although you pay course fees of around £9,250 you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects
* apply for a [student loan](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans)

### Earn a salary

Some training programmes like 'school direct (salaried)' and 'postgraduate teaching apprenticeships' offer a salary.

You spend less time in academic learning than you would on a university-led course.

Many courses give you a PGCE or PGDE in addition to QTS.

[Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/) also offers a salary. It's a 2-year programme leading to a PGDE and qualified teacher status.

## If you do not have a degree

### Do an undergraduate teacher training degree

You can get qualified teacher status as part of an undergraduate degree.

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get QTS with a:

* Bachelor of Arts (BA)
* Bachelor of Education (BEd)
* Bachelor of Science (BSc)

## If you already have teaching experience

You may be able to get qualified teacher status through a 12-week 'assessment only' programme if you also have a degree.

[Apply directly to assessment only teacher training providers](/assessment-only-providers) and ask them about entry criteria.

## If you're changing career

A career change into teaching allows you to use your experience and
passion to inspire young people.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) and [Transition to Teach](https://www.transitiontoteach.co.uk/) can support you with your career change.

## If you have a doctorate

If you have or are about to get a PHD you could consider the [researchers in schools](https://thebrilliantclub.org/researchers-in-schools/) programme.

If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could even earn a salary.
