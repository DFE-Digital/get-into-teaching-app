## Train to get qualified teacher status

You need ‘qualified teacher status’ (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

There are different ways to get qualified teacher status, for example:

* [if you want to go to university as a postgraduate student](#go-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student)

* [if you want to learn on the job in schools near you](#learn-on-the-job-in-schools-near-you)

* [if you do not have a degree](#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree)

* [if you already have teaching experience](#if-you-already-have-teaching-experience)

You can also find specialised programmes [if you're a career changer](#if-youre-a-career-changer) or [if you have a doctorate](#if-you-have-a-doctorate).

Not looking for primary or secondary teacher training? Consider teaching [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/further-education-teacher-training).

### Return to university as a postgraduate student

If you already have a degree and want to go to university again, you can do a university-led PGCE or PGDE leading to qualified teacher status.

A PGCE or PGDE is an academic qualification that you can use towards masters credits.

You spend about a third of your time in academic learning and the rest in school placements.  

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training) for certain subjects.

You can also apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training).

### Learn on the job in schools near you

If you already have a degree and want to spend as much time as possible in practical learning, you can find a training programme led by a school or group of schools.

You'll only spend about about a fifth of your time in academic learning.

Many courses even give you a PGCE or PGDE - an academic qualification which you can use towards masters credits.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part time.

Although you often have to pay course fees of around £9,250 you can get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training) for certain subjects.

You can also apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training).

Some training programmes offer a salary, although these can be harder to find.

#### Teach First

You can also consider [Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/). It's a salaried, 2-year programme leading to a PGDE and qualified teacher status.

### If you do not have a degree

You can get qualified teacher status as part of an undergraduate degree.

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get qualified teacher status with a BA honours or a BSc honours.

Courses typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years but you can [get funding](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator).

### If you already have teaching experience

If you have a degree and you're an experienced teacher, you may be able to get qualified teacher status through a 12-week 'assessment only' programme.

[Apply directly to assessment only teacher training providers](/assessment-only-providers) and ask them about entry criteria.

### If you're a career changer

A career change into teaching allows you to use your experience and passion to inspire young people.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) and [Transition to Teach](https://www.transitiontoteach.co.uk/) can support you with your career change.

### If you have a doctorate

If you have or are about to get a PHD you could consider the [researchers in schools](https://thebrilliantclub.org/researchers-in-schools/) programme.

If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could even earn a salary.
