You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

Find out how to get QTS if you:

* [have a degree](#if-you-have-a-degree) (or you're getting one)
* [do not have a degree](#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree) (and you're not already doing one)
* [are already an experienced teacher](#if-you-are-already-an-experienced-teacher)

You can also find specialised teacher training programmes if you're [changing career](#if-youre-changing-career).

Not looking to teach in primary or secondary settings? Consider teaching [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/become-a-further-education-teacher).

If you're from outside the UK, find out how you can [come to England to teach](/come-to-england-to-teach-if-you-are-a-teacher-from-outside-the-uk).

## If you have a degree

### Go back to university as a postgraduate student

With university-led teacher training you spend some of your time in academic learning, but the majority in school placements.

In addition to QTS you'll get a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification).

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects
* apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans)

### Train with a school or group of schools

#### School-centred initial teacher training (SCITT)

SCITT programmes are delivered by a network of schools and focus on training as you teach.

#### School Direct (fee-funded)

School Direct (fee-funded) programmes are delivered by groups of schools in collaboration with a SCITT or university. The content and structure of a School Direct course is broadly similar to a SCITT course, each providing school-based training.

Many SCITT and School Direct (fee-funded) programmes give you a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification) in addition to QTS.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects
* apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans)

### Earn a salary

Some teacher training programmes offer you a salary as you train. These include 'school direct (salaried)' and 'postgraduate teaching apprenticeships'.

These salaried routes are usually suitable for people with a degree and relevant school experience. 

Many 'school direct (salaried)' programmes give you a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification) in addition to QTS.

It can be easy to confuse the 'school direct (salaried)' programme with the non-salaried 'school direct' programme. Make sure you check with your chosen provider before applying.

Courses usually take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Places for salaried routes into teaching are limited and are very competitive.

[Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/) also offers a salary. It's a 2-year programme leading to a PGDE and QTS.

## If you do not have a degree

### Do an undergraduate teacher training degree

You can get QTS as part of an undergraduate degree.

Courses typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years but you can [get funding](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator).

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get QTS with a:

* Bachelor of Arts (BA)
* Bachelor of Education (BEd)
* Bachelor of Science (BSc)

## If you are already an experienced teacher

You may be able to get 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) through a 12-week 'assessment only' programme if you also have a degree.

You’ll need to show that you already meet the standards for QTS. For example, you may meet the standards if:

* you’ve already been employed as an unqualified teacher for a significant amount of time (for example, 2 years) and you’ve worked in more than one school
* [you’re a qualified teacher who trained overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk)

Entry criteria may vary by teacher training provider. Ask them about eligibility before you apply.

[Apply directly to assessment only teacher training providers](/assessment-only-providers).

## If you're changing career

A career change into teaching allows you to use your experience and
passion to inspire young people.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) and [Transition to Teach](https://www.transitiontoteach.co.uk/) can support you with your career change.
