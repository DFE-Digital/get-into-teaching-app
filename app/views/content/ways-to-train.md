You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

Find out how to get QTS if you:

* [have a degree](#if-you-have-a-degree)
* [do not have a degree](#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree)
* [already have teaching experience](#if-you-already-have-teaching-experience)

You can also find specialised training programmes if you're:

* [changing career](#if-youre-changing-career)
* [have a doctorate](#if-you-have-a-doctorate)

Not looking to teach in primary or secondary settings? Consider teaching [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/further-education-teacher-training).

## If you have a degree

### Go back to university as a postgraduate student

With university-led training you spend about a third of your time in academic learning and the rest in school placements.

In addition to QTS you'll get a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification).

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects
* apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans)

### Train as you teach at a school or group of schools

On a 'school direct (fee-funded)' programme you spend less time learning about the theory of teaching than you would in [university-led training](/ways-to-train#go-back-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student).

Despite the focus on training as you teach, many courses give you a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification) in addition to QTS.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects

### Earn a salary

Some training programmes like 'school direct (salaried)' and 'postgraduate teaching apprenticeships' offer a salary.

You spend less time learning about the theory of teaching than you would in [university-led training](/ways-to-train#go-back-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student).

Despite the focus on training as you teach, many 'school direct (salaried)' courses give you a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification) in addition to QTS.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

[Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/) also offers a salary. It's a 2-year programme leading to a PGDE and QTS.

## If you do not have a degree

### Do an undergraduate teacher training degree

You can get QTS as part of an undergraduate degree.

Courses typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years but you can [get funding](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator).

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get QTS with a:

* Bachelor of Arts (BA)
* Bachelor of Education (BEd)
* Bachelor of Science (BSc)

## If you already have teaching experience

You may be able to get QTS through a 12-week 'assessment only' programme if you also have a degree.

[Apply directly to assessment only teacher training providers](/assessment-only-providers) and ask them about entry criteria.

## If you're changing career

A career change into teaching allows you to use your experience and
passion to inspire young people.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) and [Transition to Teach](https://www.transitiontoteach.co.uk/) can support you with your career change.

## If you have a doctorate

If you have or are about to get a PHD you could consider the [researchers in schools](https://thebrilliantclub.org/researchers-in-schools/) programme.

If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could even earn a salary.
