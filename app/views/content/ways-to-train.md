With [university-led training](#compare-popular-types-of-postgraduate-primary-and-secondary-teacher-training) you spend about a third of your time in academic learning and the rest in school placements.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can get [funding that you do not have to pay back](https://review-get-into-teaching-app-1182.london.cloudapps.digital/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects.
