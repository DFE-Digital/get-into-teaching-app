You need to get 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to teach in the majority of schools in England. This includes primary, secondary and special ‘maintained schools’ - part of the state funded schools system.

You can get QTS in different ways.

For example, if you already have an undergraduate degree you can do a postgraduate initial teacher training (ITT) course which leads to QTS.

If you do not have a degree, you can do an undergraduate degree which leads to QTS.

Different types of training have different eligibility criteria, [funding options](/funding-your-training) and qualifications. Lots of courses also allow you to study part-time.

You can also [get support to improve your subject knowledge](/improve-your-subject-knowledge) to supplement your training.

Not looking for primary or secondary training? Consider training to teach [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/become-a-further-education-teacher).

$get-a-tta$

$pgce$

PGCE programmes combine academic study with a minimum of 24 weeks spent training in schools.

You do not need an academic qualification such as a PGCE to teach in England, but it may be useful if you want to teach in another country.

Many PGCE courses give you credits that count towards a master’s degree.

You can also [get funding](/funding-your-training).

#### Postgraduate Diploma in Education

Some providers offer a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) instead of a PGCE. A PGDE sometimes offers more masters credits than a PGCE.

$school-direct-fee-funded$

You’ll learn as you teach while you work towards qualified teacher status (QTS).

You’ll be based in a school but you will not be employed by them.

You’ll also be taught by the university, college, or school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) provider that the school partners with.

Most school direct programmes lead to a PGCE, but not all do. Check with the training provider before you apply.

You can also [get funding](/funding-your-training).

</p>

$school-direct-salaried$

You’ll be employed by a school as an unqualified teacher while you work towards qualified teacher status (QTS).

You’ll earn a salary and do not need to pay any tuition fees.

This route typically requires 3 years of transferable work history.

Most school direct programmes lead to a PGCE, but not all do. Check with the training provider before you apply.

</p>

$postgraduate-teaching-apprenticeship$

You’ll be employed by a school and learn while you’re working.

You’ll split your time between school and university study, with at least 20% of your time studying.

$teach-first$

The Teach First Leadership Development Programme is a 2-year salaried programme.

It combines leadership development with teacher training, and focuses on training exceptional teachers to teach in challenging schools.

You’ll learn on the job while you work towards qualified teacher status (QTS) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE).

A PGDE contains up to 120 credits at master’s degree level.

$undergraduate$

 You can get qualified teacher status (QTS) as part of an undergraduate degree course.

 This could be right for you if you do not have a degree yet.

 You can also [get funding](/funding-your-training).

 </p>

$assessment-only$

If you’re an experienced teacher with a degree, you can gain QTS without doing a teacher training programme.

You’ll need to show evidence that you meet the standards for QTS.

A number of universities and School Centred Initial Teacher Training programmes (SCITTs) offer assessment only routes. Their criteria for entry may vary.

You can apply to them directly.
