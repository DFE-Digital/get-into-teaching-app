You need 'qualified teacher status' (QTS) to work in the majority of schools in England including state maintained primary, secondary and special schools.

Find out how to get QTS if you:

* [have a degree](#if-you-have-a-degree) (or you're getting one)
* [do not have a degree](#if-you-do-not-have-a-degree) (and you're not already doing one)
* [are already an experienced teacher](#if-you-are-already-an-experienced-teacher)

You can also find specialised training programmes if you're [changing career](#if-youre-changing-career) or you [have a doctorate](#if-you-have-a-doctorate).

Not looking to teach in primary or secondary settings? Consider teaching [early years](/early-years-teaching-training) or [further education](/further-education-teacher-training).

## If you have a degree

### Go back to university as a postgraduate student

With university-led training you spend about a third of your time in academic learning and the rest in school placements.

In addition to QTS you'll get a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification).

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects
* apply for a [student loan](/funding-your-training#tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans)

### Train as you teach at a school or group of schools

On a 'school direct (fee-funded)' programme you spend less time learning about the theory of teaching than you would in [university-led training](/ways-to-train#go-back-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student).

Despite the focus on training as you teach, many courses give you a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification) in addition to QTS.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

Fees are usually around £9,250 but you can:

* get [funding that you do not have to pay back](/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships) for certain subjects

### Earn a salary

Some training programmes like 'school direct (salaried)' and 'postgraduate teaching apprenticeships' offer a salary.

You spend less time learning about the theory of teaching than you would in [university-led training](/ways-to-train#go-back-to-university-as-a-postgraduate-student).

Despite the focus on training as you teach, many 'school direct (salaried)' courses give you a PGCE or PGDE (an academic qualification) in addition to QTS.

Courses typically take one year but you may be able to study part-time.

[Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/) also offers a salary. It's a 2-year programme leading to a PGDE and QTS.

## If you do not have a degree

### Do an undergraduate teacher training degree

You can get QTS as part of an undergraduate degree.

Courses typically cost £9,250 per year and can take up to 4 years but you can [get funding](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator).

Qualifications vary depending on the course. For example, you could get QTS with a:

* Bachelor of Arts (BA)
* Bachelor of Education (BEd)
* Bachelor of Science (BSc)

## If you are already an experienced teacher

You may be able to get QTS through a 12-week 'assessment only' programme if you also have a degree.

You’ll need to show that you already meet the standards for QTS. For example, you may meet the standards if:

* you’ve already been employed as an unqualified teacher for a significant amount of time (for example, 2 years) and you’ve worked in more than one school
* [you’re a qualified teacher who trained overseas](/come-to-england-to-teach-if-you-are-a-teacher-from-outside-the-uk)

Entry criteria may vary by teacher training provider. Ask them about eligibility before you apply.

[Apply directly to assessment only teacher training providers](/assessment-only-providers).

## If you're changing career

A career change into teaching allows you to use your experience and
passion to inspire young people.

[Now Teach](https://nowteach.org.uk/) and [Transition to Teach](https://www.transitiontoteach.co.uk/) can support you with your career change.

## If you have a doctorate

If you have or are about to get a PHD you could consider the [researchers in schools](https://thebrilliantclub.org/researchers-in-schools/) programme.

If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could even earn a salary.
