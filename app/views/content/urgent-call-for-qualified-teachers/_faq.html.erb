  <summary>How do I find a school to work in?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>
      We recommend you <a href="#please-register-with-a-supply-teaching-agency-now">contact
        a supply teaching agency directly</a> rather than any school. This is to
      avoid additional burdens on schools, and because supply agencies work
      directly with schools who need more staff. Agencies can help you to complete
      the necessary pre-employment checks.

  <summary>How do I find a supply agency?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      You can <a href="#please-register-with-a-supply-teaching-agency-now">find a supply
        teaching agency</a> near you. You can also contact other supply agencies
      you know, even if they are not on this list.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will I need to complete pre-employment checks, such as DBS checks?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      A supply teaching agency will be able to let you know what steps to take.
      They will support you to complete any other pre-employment checks.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Who pays for the DBS?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      A supply teaching agency will let you know about any costs. Some supply
      agencies will cover the cost of the DBS check, so check with them directly.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much will I get paid?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      The level of pay is agreed between the school, agency and supply teacher.
      You may be subject to deductions for tax on any earnings and/or National
      Insurance contributions, depending on your circumstances.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will my teachers’ pension be impacted if I return as a supply teacher?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      It will depend on who your employer is. Supply teaching agencies do not
      participate in the Teachers’ Pensions Scheme (TPS) and therefore returning
      to teaching in this way will not affect your pension. Local authorities
      (LAs), academies and further education colleges do participate in the TPS.
      If you are employed directly as a supply teacher by one of these
      organisations, then you can
      <a href="https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/calculators/how-much-can-you-earn-as-a-retired-member.aspx">check how this may affect you.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will travel costs be covered?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      Travel costs will not be paid by the Department for Education. Check with
      the supply agency whether they reimburse travel costs.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What information will the supply agency need?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      Agencies have varying requirements. But as a minimum you will be asked to
      provide:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Evidence that you have a suitable qualification, for example: Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)</li>
      <li>Information to verify your identity and right to work</li>
      <li>Information to enable references to be taken.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What information will the school need?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      The agency will liaise with the school on your behalf, so you will not need
      to provide information to the school directly.
      <p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I find out about the school that I will be teaching in?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      Your agency will provide you with information about the school before you
      start any placement.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What am I expected to teach?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      The supply teaching agency will work with you to understand your experience
      and preferences. This will help them find appropriate placements for you.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How quickly will I be placed?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      All pre-employment checks will need to be
      completed before any placement. Once these have been completed, placement
      timing will depend on demand from schools or colleges.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to be vaccinated before working in a school?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are the best way to protect people from
      coronavirus (COVID-19) and will save thousands of lives. We encourage all
      the workforce to take <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/">up the offer of a vaccine and a booster</a> where
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no specific duty in the regulations on employees or those seeking
      employment to share their vaccine status with employers. We expect schools,
      like all employers, to give due consideration to their obligations under
      the Equality Act 2010.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I’m worried about going into a school, what are schools doing to ensure they are COVID-safe?</summary>

  <div>
    <p>
      As of 13 December 2021, 89% of all adults and children over 12 years old in
      England have received at least one dose of a vaccine, 81.1% have received a
      second dose and 40.8% have received a booster (or third dose). Vaccines
      remain an effective measure against COVID-19 and we encourage everyone to
      <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/">take up the offer of a vaccine and booster where possible</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      All settings have a range of measures in place to manage COVID-19
      transmission day to day, for example ventilation and hygiene for all
      settings, and regular testing for the workforce and learners in year 7 and
      above.
    </p>

    <p>
      The measures in place day-to-day in education settings are based on the
      latest scientific advice and strike a balance between managing transmission
      risk and reducing disruption to children and young people’s education.
    </p>

    <p>
      All staff, including temporary staff, across all education settings are
      encouraged to continue testing twice-weekly from home.
    </p>

    <p>
      All settings have contingency plans to reflect the possibility of increased
      use of lateral flow device (LFD) testing by staff and, where they are already
      being offered testing, for pupils and students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Employers should be able to explain the measures they have in place to keep
      staff safe at work. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has published
      guidance on protecting vulnerable workers, including advice for employers and
      employees on how to talk about reducing risks in the workplace. Employers
      should discuss concerns with staff.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Department for Education continues to work closely with the Department of
      Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA),
      informed by the latest scientific evidence and advice, to revise our COVID-19
      safe working and protective measures for settings in England.
