School experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

Spending some time in a school allows you to:

* observe lessons and other teacher responsibilities
* talk to teachers
* get an insight into day-to-day school life

It can also really help [your teacher training application](/tips-on-applying-for-teacher-training), although it’s not a training entry requirement.

To find experience you can:

* [request early years, primary or secondary experience on GOV.UK](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/) - not all schools advertise experience here and some only offer online experience due to coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions
* approach schools yourself

## Approach schools yourself

[Find schools near you](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) and give them a ring to find out who to talk to about getting school experience.

It's normal to have to try a few schools before you find one that can help.

They're not obliged to offer experience and may be limiting visitors due to coronavirus (COVID-19).

They also need to be careful about allowing visitors into the school for the safety of children and young people.

You may be asked to have a DBS check to ensure you're safe to work with children.

Be flexible with your availability if possible and persevere with your search.

## Maths or physics teaching internships

[Find a paid teaching internship if you’re doing an undergraduate degree in science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM)](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teaching-internship-providers).

## If you cannot get into the classroom right now

[Observe teachers’ lessons and analysis of their lessons on the Oak National Academy website](https://teachers.thenational.academy/lessons-for-itt).

These videos are not a claim of best practice but can help you get to know teaching better.

[Events](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/events) can also help you get to know teaching.
