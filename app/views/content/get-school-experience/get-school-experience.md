School experience can help you decide whether teaching is right for you.

Spending some time in a school allows you to:

* observe lessons and other teacher responsibilities
* talk to teachers
* get an insight into day-to-day school life

To find experience you can:

* [find a school offering experience through GOV.UK](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/)
* approach schools yourself

## Approach schools yourself

[Find schools near you](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) and give them a ring to find out who to talk to about getting school experience.

It's normal to have to try a few schools before you find one that can help.

They may be limiting visitors due to coronavirus (COVID-19) and may need to organise a DBS check.

Be flexible with your availability if possible and persevere with your search.

## Maths or physics teaching internships

If you are interested in teaching secondary maths or physics, and you are an undergraduate on a STEM related degree, you may be eligible for a paid Teaching Internship. This provides an opportunity to experience the teaching profession, gain new skills and be paid £300 per week for your time. [Find a paid teaching internship](/teaching-internship-providers).

## If you cannot get into the classroom right now

[Observe teachers’ lessons and analysis of their lessons on the Oak National Academy website](https://teachers.thenational.academy/lessons-for-itt).

These videos are not a claim of best practice but can help you get to know teaching better.

[Events](/events) can also give you an insight into teaching.
