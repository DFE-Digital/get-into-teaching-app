      <h3>Every day is the same</h3>
      <p>
        "One day I’ll be playing bingo to make maths fun, the next exploring
        how maths underpins the economy."
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>I miss adult conversation</h3>
      <p>
        "At every school I’ve worked in, the teachers have always been super
        supportive. We love to have a laugh too. Weekly pub visits are the
        norm!"
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Every day is the same</h3>
      <p>
        "When the school day ends, I switch off and focus on my own stuff. I
        value my down time a lot. Plus, I make the most of the longer holiday
        and spend most summers in Greece."
