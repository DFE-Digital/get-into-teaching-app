    <h2>It all started with my love of maths</h2>

    <p>
      I've always found it fascinating learning how maths shapes the world we
      live in, but it was my passionate, down-to-earth teachers who had the
      biggest impact on me.
    </p>

    <h2>After Uni I knew I wanted to teach</h2>

    <p>
      I started off by tutoring, which was a great way to get to grips with
      teaching quickly. Although I’m from Greece, I chose to do a PGCE in the UK
      because it has one of the best educational systems in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>I’ve worked out how to get every student interested in maths</h2>

    <p>
      Some kids will say &quot;I can’t do algebra&quot; or &quot;I don’t like numbers.&quot;
      And to be honest, I know how that feels. I&apos;m definitely more a fan of Pure
      maths than other topics. I try to find out what they’re interested in – whether
      it’s card games, football or whatever – and use this to make maths relevant.

    <h2>It all started with my own experiences</h2>

    <p>
      I really enjoyed the coaching aspect of the degree and getting to see the
      kids improve. After uni, I did a few odd jobs from bathroom selling to
      recruitment. But nothing had that ‘feel good factor.’ But then I took a
      cover job in a local school and I fell in love with teaching.
    </p>

    <h2>The move from basketball to biology was easier than I thought</h2>

    <p>
      When the assistant head suggested teaching science, I wasn’t sure I was cut
      out for it, I’d never been that academic myself. It turned out my degree
      covered a lot of the science curriculum, so I decided to give it a go. I’ve
      never looked back.
    </p>

    <h2>I discovered that science is all about making connections</h2>

    <p>
      I’m always showing my students how science relates to everything they’re
      learning. From enzymes in cooking to the surprising history of a lot of
      medical discoveries. I love it when they ask a question that I’ve never
      even thought of.
    </p>

    <h2>It all started with my degree in sports science</h2>

    <p>
      Going to uni wasn't the norm where I'm from, but my teachers always
      encouraged me. They made me believe that I could achieve anything. Plus,
      I've always loved English. Believe me, I'm a proper library nerd.
    </p>

    <h2>I couldn’t wait to teach English</h2>

    <p>
      After uni, I completed my PGCE and quickly started teaching at an Academy.
      I threw myself into the job and focused on developing a real reading
      culture at the school. I knew that improving the literacy rates of every
      student would make a huge difference, especially with kids who aren’t from
      privileged backgrounds.
    </p>

    <h2>I realised that teaching English gives every student a voice</h2>

    <p>
      When a student can read and talk about their views, it opens them up to so
      many opportunities. It’s all about having confidence, and I can actually
      play a part in making that happen.
    </p>

    <h2>I knew I wanted to use my degree after graduating</h2>

    <p>
      Some of my friends were going into office jobs, but that just wasn’t for
      me. Speaking another language is such a gift – you can connect with other
      people and cultures. And after 4 years studying Spanish at uni, I wanted to
      share that passion with others.
    </p>

    <h2>Teaching abroad was a great experience</h2>

    <p>
      I taught English for a year whilst living in northern Spain, which really
      took me out of my comfort zone. Seeing the students' enthusiasm for
      languages made me want to continue teaching when I returned home so I
      decided to train to teach at a school in Coventry, where I still work now.
    </p>

    <h2>I quickly realised how creative I could be in the classroom</h2>

    <p>
      There are loads of fun ways to bring languages to life. For a challenging
      GCSE class, speed dating in Spanish really got their attention! For the
      younger students, they love pretending to order off the restaurant menus
      that I bring back from my holidays in Spain.

    <h2>From trainee teacher to Assistant Headteacher. See how Helen’s career progressed.</h2>
     
    <p>
      Helen Winter started out as a lawyer. After re-evaluating her career, she
      embarked on a journey from lawyer to teacher. In just two years, she’s
      become Assistant Headteacher. She now has her eyes set on an even brighter
      future in teaching.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      Two years after I qualified as a teacher, I was Head of Department. I loved
      the job from the start. There's no better feeling than watching a child
      succeed, especially if they have had to overcome obstacles or are lacking
      self-belief.
    </p>

    <h2>She then went from Head of Department to Assistant Headteacher</h2>
     
    <p>
      Over the next two years, my progression was rapid and I've been very
      fortunate to be promoted quickly. If you're passionate and committed, the
      teaching world is very much your oyster. There are so many opportunities to
      climb the ladder.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s next? Assistant Headteacher to Deputy Headteacher...?</h2>
     
    <p>
      I'd love to apply for Deputy Headteacher. After that? Who knows! It's good
      to see women in senior positions and I hope to be one of them. Just
      remember, pupils are at the heart of everything we do and determination can
      help you achieve your goals.
