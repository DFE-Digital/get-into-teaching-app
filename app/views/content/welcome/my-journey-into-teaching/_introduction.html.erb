  <h2>
    It all started with my love of maths
  </h2>

  <p>
    I've always found it fascinating learning how maths shapes the world we
    live in, but it was my passionate, down-to-earth teachers who had the
    biggest impact on me.

  <h2>After Uni I knew I wanted to teach</h2>

  <p>
    I started off by tutoring, which was a great way to get to grips with
    teaching quickly. Although I’m from Greece, I chose to do a PGCE in the UK
    because it has one of the best educational systems in the world.

  <h2>I’ve worked out how to get every student interested in maths</h2>

  <p>
    Some kids will say &quot;I can’t do algebra&quot; or &quot;I don’t like numbers.&quot;
    And to be honest, I know how that feels. I&apos;m definitely more a fan of Pure
    maths than other topics. I try to find out what they’re interested in – whether
    it’s card games, football or whatever – and use this to make maths relevant.
