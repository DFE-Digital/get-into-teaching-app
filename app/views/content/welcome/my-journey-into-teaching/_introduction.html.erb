    <h2>It all started with my love of maths</h2>

    <p>
      I've always found it fascinating learning how maths shapes the world we
      live in, but it was my passionate, down-to-earth teachers who had the
      biggest impact on me.
    </p>

    <h2>After uni I knew I wanted to teach</h2>

    <p>
      I started off by tutoring, which was a great way to get to grips with
      teaching quickly. Although I’m from Greece, I chose to do a PGCE in the UK
      because it has one of the best educational systems in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>I’ve worked out how to get every student interested in maths</h2>

    <p>
      Some kids will say &quot;I can’t do algebra&quot; or &quot;I don’t like numbers&quot;.
      And to be honest, I know how that feels. I&apos;m definitely more a fan of pure
      maths than other topics. I try to find out what they’re interested in – whether
      it’s card games, football or whatever – and use this to make maths relevant.
    </p>

    <h2>What may surprise you?</h2>

    <p>
      I didn’t always love maths – it wasn’t until later in secondary school
      that I discovered my potential.
    </p>

    <h2>It’s not always easy</h2>

    <p>
      The relationship that you have with the students is so special, and I did
      struggle with remote learning during lockdown as it was harder to connect
      with them. I missed them making jokes!
    </p>

    <h2>It all started with my own experiences</h2>

    <p>
      I really enjoyed the coaching aspect of the degree and getting to see the
      kids improve. After uni, I did a few odd jobs from bathroom selling to
      recruitment. But nothing had that ‘feel good factor.’ But then I took a
      cover job in a local school and I fell in love with teaching.
    </p>

    <h2>The move from basketball to biology was easier than I thought</h2>

    <p>
      When the assistant head suggested teaching science, I wasn’t sure I was cut
      out for it, I’d never been that academic myself. It turned out my degree
      covered a lot of the science curriculum, so I decided to give it a go. I’ve
      never looked back.
    </p>

    <h2>I discovered that science is all about making connections</h2>

    <p>
      I’m always showing my students how science relates to everything they’re
      learning. From enzymes in cooking to the surprising history of a lot of
      medical discoveries. I love it when they ask a question that I’ve never
      even thought of.
    </p>

    <h2>It all started with my degree in sports science</h2>

    <p>
      Going to uni wasn't the norm where I'm from, but my teachers always
      encouraged me. They made me believe that I could achieve anything. Plus,
      I've always loved English. Believe me, I'm a proper library nerd.
    </p>

    <h2>I couldn’t wait to teach English</h2>

    <p>
      After uni, I completed my PGCE and started teaching at an academy.
      I threw myself into the job and focused on developing a real reading
      culture at the school. I knew that improving the literacy rates of every
      student would make a huge difference, especially with kids who aren’t from
      privileged backgrounds.
    </p>

    <h2>I realised that teaching English gives every student a voice</h2>

    <p>
      When a student can read and talk about their views, it opens them up to so
      many opportunities. It’s all about having confidence, and I can actually
      play a part in making that happen.
    </p>

    <h2>It’s not always easy</h2>

    <p>
      I teach in a school where some kids come from quite difficult
      backgrounds. One girl I taught was convinced that she couldn’t study
      English, but now she’s doing incredibly well and has the GCSEs to prove
      it!
    </p>

    <h2>I’ve risen through the ranks quickly</h2>

    <p>
      I've gone from trainee teacher to head of English in less than 5 years. I
      had a bit of imposter syndrome at first, but I've quickly realised that
      even though it’s a big role, the focus on the students hasn’t changed at
      all.
    </p>

  <% elsif subject_category == "languages" %>

    <h2>I knew I wanted to use my degree after graduating</h2>

    <p>
      Some of my friends were going into office jobs, but that just wasn’t for
      me. Speaking another language is such a gift – you can connect with other
      people and cultures. And after 4 years studying Spanish at uni, I wanted to
      share that passion with others.
    </p>

    <h2>Teaching abroad was a great experience</h2>

    <p>
      I taught English for a year whilst living in northern Spain, which really
      took me out of my comfort zone. Seeing the students' enthusiasm for
      languages made me want to continue teaching when I returned home so I
      decided to train to teach at a school in Coventry, where I still work now.
    </p>

    <h2>I quickly realised how creative I could be in the classroom</h2>

    <p>
      There are loads of fun ways to bring languages to life. For a challenging
      GCSE class, speed dating in Spanish really got their attention! For the
      younger students, they love pretending to order off the restaurant menus
      that I bring back from my holidays in Spain.

    <h2>From trainee teacher to head of maths, see how Abigail’s career progressed.</h2>

    <p>
      Abigail wasn’t sure what she wanted to do when she graduated with a maths
      and management degree. She knew she wanted to go into a leadership role
      but it was after attending a Train to Teach event that she realised
      teaching was right for her.
    </p>

    <h2>Influencing from the beginning</h2>

    <p>
      As a newly qualified teacher, she had lots of ideas she wanted to try out
      and became numeracy coordinator within a few months.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <blockquote>This was a new role in the school, so I could really make it my own.</blockquote>
    </figure>

    <h2>Rising through the ranks</h2>

    <p>
      In her third year as a teacher, Abigail was promoted to senior leadership.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <blockquote>What I like most about being in a leadership role is having more responsibility for key decisions and empowering others. I’m ultimately impacting on pupils’ lives and the experience that they have at school.</blockquote>
    </figure>

    <h2>What’s next?</h2>

    <p>
      After getting a National Professional Qualification for Senior Leadership
      (NPQSL), she plans to continue to progress and shape the lives of the
      future generation.
    </p>

    <h2>A final word of advice:</h2>
