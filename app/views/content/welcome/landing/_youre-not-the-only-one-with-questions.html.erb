    <h2 class="blue">You're not the only one with questions</h2>

    <p class="blue">
      We get it. As a third-year student, you’re going to have certain
      questions. Here are the answers to a couple we think you’ll be
      particularly interested in.

    <div class="intro">
      Here’s what some of our newly qualified teachers have to say about
      overcoming some of the most common challenges.

      <div class="question-and-answer">
        <p class="q">
          I already have a student loan. Will I be eligible for the teacher training funding?
        </p>

        <p class="a">
          Yes you will be! There are lots of financial support available,
          including a student loan of up to £9,250 to cover your course fees and
          a maintenance loan of up to £12,010 to help with living costs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question-and-answer">
        <p class="q">
          Am I too young to teach? I don’t have experience!
        </p>

        <p class="a">
          Don’t worry. Throughout teacher training, you’ll get support from
          mentors who will help you feel confident in the classroom. And you’re
          not alone, last year thousands of students like you went on to become teachers.
