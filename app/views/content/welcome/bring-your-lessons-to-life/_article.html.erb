    Jack is a PE teacher from Leeds, with a passion for opening up conversations
    around mental health in schools.

    I’m a massive advocate for keeping
    yourself fit and strong, both physically and mentally. As a teacher, I’ve
    always been passionate about finding ways to help my students feel mentally
    strong, because it means they’re in a much better place to learn.

    When I started leading on mental health in my school I thought, ‘how can I
    get this message to as many students as possible?’. I wanted to do
    something different – something that would really get their attention. A
    few of my friends had set up podcasts, and I thought it seemed like a great
    way to do it. So I started the
    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5l0JSWkC8qiL1b0oXORbll">Philips Positive Podcast</a>,
    which invites teachers to share their own mental health stories and
    provides tips to help pupils be able to cope with life’s stresses and
    anxieties.

    We’ve got loads of listeners, even kids from different schools. Parents tell me
    they listen too – they tell me they’ve had some really frank &amp; open
    conversations with their kids about how they feel. There are a few lads who I
    thought would never give it a chance, and for them to go away and listen means
    the world to me, I’m well chuffed!
  </p>

  <p>
    Now I want to take the podcast even further – maybe set up a website that gives
    more support to young people with their mental health.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think people feel comfortable talking to me, and I want to continue to open up that conversation.
