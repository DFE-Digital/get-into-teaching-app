    I’ve always loved listening to rap music, I was just 12 when I started writing
    my own songs and spoken word poems. I just couldn’t get enough of the lyrics –
    I was constantly trying to unpick them. They can really change how you see the
    world. When I started teaching, I thought this would be a great thing to take
    into the classroom.

    Lots of the English curriculum is classic texts and the kids sometimes find it
    hard to relate to. Rap just makes it more relevant. I mix up Shakespeare quotes
    with Hip Hop lyrics and the students have to guess which is which. It opens
    up the conversation and helps them make sense of it.

    When I started rapping in the classroom, the kids were all saying, “Miss, you
    can’t rap, you’re a teacher!” The next day, I brought in my speakers and
    started doing it. You could see them thinking, “Wow, this a different way of
    learning.” Even the quiet ones started speaking up, which is what it’s all
    about.
