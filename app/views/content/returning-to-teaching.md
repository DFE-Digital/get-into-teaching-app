Returning to teaching can be easier than you expect.

More than ever, our children and young people need your skills and experience back in the classroom.  

If you’re thinking about returning to teaching, or if you’re qualified to teach but have never taught in a state school in England, we can help.

If you trained to teach in the UK and are a UK citizen currently working abroad, find out about [returning to England to teach](/non-uk-teachers/return-to-england-after-teaching-overseas).

## Why now?

Thousands of former teachers return to teaching each year.

Now could be a great time for you to become a teacher again and help support education recovery.

Here at the Department for Education, we’re taking action to address some of the common issues that teachers face in the classroom. This includes helping schools to:

* [reduce workload](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [support mental health and wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-staff-wellbeing-charter)
* [enable flexible working](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools)
* [manage behaviour](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs)

The education sector promotes inclusivity and diversity. There are many organisations that support teachers with protected characteristics, such as [WomenEd](https://www.womened.org/), [BAMEed](https://www.bameednetwork.com/), [LGBTed](https://www.outteacher.org/) and [DisabilityEd](https://www.twitter.com/disability_ed).

[Search for jobs, including those with flexible working patterns, on Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

## Get a return to teaching adviser

If you have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) and you want to return to teach at a secondary school in England, you could be eligible for a [return to teaching adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/).

A return to teaching adviser can give you free one-to-one support with:

* the applications process, such as writing personal statements and preparing for interviews
* accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge or teaching practice, such as national professional qualifications (NPQs)
* finding teaching vacancies

Chat through email, text or phone, as little or as much as you'd like.

Return to teaching advisers also run [events to support returners](/events).

## Join the National Tutoring Programme

The National Tutoring Programme supports schools with helping children get back up to speed after the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic. It also provides different options to return to a school without taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role. 

If you’re looking for an alternative to taking on a teaching role, the [National Tutoring Programme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-tutoring-programme-guidance-for-schools-2022-to-2023) could be it. Through it, you can tutor or mentor children and help provide support to disadvantaged pupils.

## Find a role

Teaching Vacancies is the government’s free, national job listing service for the teaching profession. [Search for a teaching role in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.

Take a look at the different [types of schools and staff roles](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)
to find the best opportunity for you. Vacancies with flexible working opportunities are listed on the service.

## Use the early career framework (ECF) resources

The [early career framework resources](https://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/) help early career teachers (ECTs) with their learning and development. They're accredited by the Department for Education (DfE).

If you're returning to teaching, you can use these online resources to support you in your journey back into the classroom. Find material to refresh your knowledge on behaviour management, pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and professional behaviours.

## If you've been out of teaching for a while

If you’re returning to teaching, you might want to re-familiarise yourself with life in a classroom. Here are lots of ways that you can do it.

### Reading teachers' stories and tips

* browse [inspirational stories](/blog/tag/returning-to-teaching) from Stephen, Farooq and Maria who returned to the classroom successfully after a break
* read up on [teaching interview tips](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2019/04/04/job-interviews) and get [pointers on remote interviews](/blog/how-to-ace-a-video-interview)

### Catching up on changes

* review the latest [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)
* catch up on changes to the [national curriculum and qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/topic/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications)
* read through [current behaviour management guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools)
* learn about how DfE have improved the [National Professional Qualifications (NPQs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms) and if you may be eligible for a fully funded scholarship 

### Other things to consider

* attend an [online return to teaching event](/events)
* join the [Chartered College of Teaching](https://chartered.college/), the
  professional body for teachers
* join a [teaching union](https://www.tes.com/jobs/careers-advice/pay-and-conditions/which-teachers-union)
* ensure your [pension](https://www.teacherspensions.co.uk/members/working-life/deferring-your-pension/return-to-pensionable-service.aspx), one of your key benefits, is up to date
