If you’re thinking about returning to the classroom, you might want to [get a return to teaching adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/). They can give you free one-to-one support, helping you get back into teaching. 

## Why now

Thousands of former teachers return to teaching each year.

Now could be a great time for you to become a teacher again and help support education recovery.

Here at the Department for Education, we’re taking action to address some of the common issues that teachers face in the classroom. This includes helping schools to:

* [reduce workload](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [support mental health and wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-staff-wellbeing-charter)
* [enable flexible working](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools)
* [manage behaviour](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs)

The education sector promotes inclusivity and diversity. There are many organisations that support teachers with protected characteristics, such as [WomenEd](https://www.womened.org/), [BAMEed](https://www.bameednetwork.com/), [LGBTed](https://www.outteacher.org/) and [DisabilityEd](https://www.twitter.com/disability_ed).

[Search for jobs, including those with flexible working patterns, on Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

## Join the National Tutoring Programme

The National Tutoring Programme supports schools with helping children get back up to speed after the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic. It also provides different options to return to a school without taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role. 

If you’re looking for an alternative to taking on a teaching role, the [National Tutoring Programme](https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/) could be it. Through it, you can tutor or mentor children and help provide support to disadvantaged pupils.

## Get a return to teaching adviser

If you have [qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) and you want to return to teach at a secondary school in England, you could get a [return to teaching adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/). You'll need to be qualified to teach (one of the following):

* modern foreign languages
* maths
* physics
* chemistry
* computing

A return to teaching adviser can give free one-to-one support with:

* the applications process, such as writing personal statements and preparing for interviews
* accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge
* finding teaching vacancies

## Find a role

Teaching Vacancies is the government’s free, national job listing service for the teaching profession. [Search for a teaching role in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.

Take a look at the different [types of schools and staff roles](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)
to find the best opportunity for you. Vacancies with flexible working opportunities are listed on the service.
