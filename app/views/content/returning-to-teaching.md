Returning to teaching might be easier than you expect.

After a period of disruption for so many pupils, you could help those most affected to get back on track, including engaging with the [National Tutoring Programme](#national-tutoring-programme). Bring your valuable experience back to the classroom with help from the Department for Education.

If you’re considering coming back to the profession, or if you’re qualified to teach but have never taught in a state school in England, we’re here to help.

## Why now

Thousands of former teachers return to teaching each year.

Now could be a great time for you to become a teacher again and help support education recovery.

Here at the Department for Education, we’re taking action to address some of the common issues that teachers face in the classroom. This includes helping schools to:

* [reduce workload](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [support mental health and wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-staff-wellbeing-charter)
* [enable flexible working](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools)
* [manage behaviour](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs)

The education sector promotes inclusivity and diversity. There are many organisations that support teachers with protected characteristics, such as [WomenEd](https://www.womened.org/), [BAMEed](https://www.bameednetwork.com/), [LGBTed](https://lgbted.uk/) and [DisabilityEd](https://www.twitter.com/disability_ed).

[Search for jobs, including those with flexible working patterns, on Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

## Get a return to teaching adviser

If you have '[qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts)' and you want to return to teach modern foreign languages, maths or physics at secondary school in England, a [return to teaching adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) can give free one-to-one support with:

* the applications process, such as writing personal statements and preparing for interviews
* accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge
* finding teaching vacancies

## Find a role

Teaching Vacancies is the government’s free, national job listing service for the teaching profession. [Search for a teaching role in England](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
You can set up job alerts so that you do not miss out on any opportunities.

Take a look at the different [types of schools and staff roles](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school)
to find the best opportunity for you. Vacancies with flexible working opportunities are listed on the service.

## National Tutoring Programme

The National Tutoring Programme supports schools to close the attainment gap in light of the coronavirus pandemic and provides different options to return to a school environment without taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role.

If you’re unsure about taking on a teacher role at this time, [consider applying to tutor or mentor through the National Tutoring Programme](https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/) and help provide support to disadvantaged pupils.

## If you've been out of teaching for a while
