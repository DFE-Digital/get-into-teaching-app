Funding is available to help you train to teach. You can apply for a:

- tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover your teacher training, so you do not need to pay course fees upfront
- maintenance loan of up to £12,382 to help with living costs

You can still apply for a tuition fee and a maintenance loan if you already have a student loan, and regardless of whether you get a teaching bursary or scholarship.

You will only have to make loan repayments once you’re earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take an additional loan for teacher training.

You may be eligible for a teaching [bursary or scholarship](/scholarships-and-bursaries) when training to teach.
