## In the UK

You’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body to find out about your eligibility for funding if you live in:

- [Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/)
- [Scotland](https://www.saas.gov.uk/)
- [Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/)

Contact the education authority if you live in:

- [Jersey](https://www.gov.je/Working/Careers/16To19YearOlds/EnteringHigherEducation/FinancingHigherEducationCourses/FundingDegreeProfessionalQualifications/Pages/index.aspx)
- [Guernsey](https://www.gov.gg/article/152744/Policies)
- [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/student-grants)

## Outside the UK

If you’re not a UK citizen, you are unlikely to get help funding your training unless you have permission to [live permanently in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk), for example under the EU Settlement Scheme. You will also need to meet some other eligibility requirements.
