## Tuition fee and maintenance loans

Funding is available to help you [train to teach](/ways-to-train). You can apply for a:

* tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover your teacher training, so you do not need to pay course fees upfront
* maintenance loan of up to £12,382 to help with living costs

You can still apply for a tuition fee and a maintenance loan if you already have a student loan, and regardless of whether you get a teaching bursary or scholarship.

You will only have to make loan repayments once you're earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take an additional loan for teacher training.

## Bursaries and scholarships

You may be eligible for a teaching bursary or scholarship when training to teach.

These are tax-free amounts of money you receive to train in certain subjects. You do not need to pay them back.

You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically receive it.

Scholarships are offered by independent institutions. They set their own eligibility criteria and you’ll need to apply through the relevant scholarship body.

### Postgraduate bursaries and scholarships

Postgraduate teaching bursaries and scholarships are only available for the subjects listed
below. You cannot receive both a teaching bursary and a scholarship.

| Subject                                          | Bursary  | Scholarship      |
| -------------                                    | -------: | ---------------: |
| **Biology**                                      | £10,000  |                  |
| **Chemistry**                                    | £24,000  | £26,000          |
| **Computing**                                    | £24,000  | £26,000          |
| **Design and technology**                        | £15,000  |                  |
| **Geography**                                    | £15,000  |                  |
| **Languages**<br/> (including ancient languages) | £15,000  |                  |
| **Maths**                                        | £24,000  | £26,000          |
| **Physics**                                      | £24,000  | £26,000          |

To be eligible for a bursary, you'll need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master's degree
* a PhD

You’ll also need to meet the bursary scheme’s individual terms and conditions.

[Find out more about your eligibility for teaching bursaries](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2022-to-2023).

To find out if you’re eligible for a scholarship and to apply, you can visit the relevant scholarship body:

* the [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/awards-funding/funding/teacher-training-scholarships/) (chemistry)
* [BCS The Chartered Institute for IT](https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/certification-and-scholarships-for-teachers/bcs-computer-teacher-scholarships/) (computing)
* the [Institute of Mathematics and its Applications](http://teachingmathsscholars.org/about) (maths)
* the [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/iop-teacher-training-scholarships#gref) (physics)

### Undergraduate bursaries

You may be eligible for a [bursary of £9,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2022-to-2023#undergraduate-bursary) if you do a secondary maths or physics course that leads to '[qualified teacher status](/what-is-qts)' (QTS).

You may also be eligible if you do an opt-in QTS course in secondary computing, languages, mathematics or physics. This is where you start a standard undergraduate degree but then opt-in to initial teacher training to get QTS.

The amount you receive depends on the year that you start your QTS course. You do not get a bursary in every year of an undergraduate course. Depending on the type of course you do, you may get the bursary in your final year or final two years.

#### If you are former military personnel

You may be eligible for a [Troops to Teachers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2022-to-2023#troops-to-teachers-undergraduate-bursary) tax-free bursary of £40,000 if you're:

* training to teach secondary biology, physics, chemistry, computing, maths or languages
* doing an undergraduate degree leading to QTS in England

## If you're a parent or carer

 If you have children or other caring responsibilities you may be able to get extra financial support through the following grants and schemes:

* [Childcare Grant](https://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant)
* [Parents' Learning Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/parents-learning-allowance)
* [Adult Dependants’ Grant](https://www.gov.uk/adult-dependants-grant)

## If you're disabled

You may be able to [get support if you’re a student and you’re disabled, have a learning difficulty or health problem](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa/how-to-claim).

[If you do paid training you may also be eligible for support](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work).

[Learn more about training to teach if you're disabled](/get-support-training-to-teach-if-you-are-disabled).

## If you come from outside England

If you live in [Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/), [Scotland](https://www.saas.gov.uk/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/) you’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body to learn more about your eligibility for funding.

Contact the education authority if you live in the Channel Islands ([Jersey](https://www.gov.je/Working/Careers/16To19YearOlds/EnteringHigherEducation/FinancingHigherEducationCourses/FundingDegreeProfessionalQualifications/Pages/index.aspx) and [Guernsey](https://www.gov.gg/article/152744/Policies)) or on the [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/student-grants).

If you’re not a UK citizen, you are unlikely to get help funding your training unless you have permission to [live permanently in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk), for example under the EU Settlement Scheme. You will also need to meet some other eligibility requirements.
