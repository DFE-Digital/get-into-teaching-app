## Tuition fee and maintenance loans

You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover your teacher training, so you don't need to pay course fees upfront. You can also apply for a maintenance loan of up to £12,382 to help with living costs.

You can still apply for a tuition fee and a maintenance loan if you already have a student loan, and regardless of whether you get a bursary or scholarship.

You will only have to make loan repayments once you're earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take an additional loan for teacher training.

## Bursaries and scholarships

You may be eligible for a bursary or scholarship when training to teach. These are tax-free amounts of money you receive to train in certain subjects. You don’t need to pay them back.

You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible for a bursary, as well as meeting the bursary scheme's individual terms and conditions. [Get further guidance on your eligibility for bursaries](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2021-to-2022).

For a scholarship, each professional scholarship body sets its own criteria. These bodies include the [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/awards-funding/funding/teacher-training-scholarships/) (chemistry), [BCS The Chartered Institute for IT](https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/certification-and-scholarships-for-teachers/bcs-computer-teacher-scholarships/) (computing), [Mathematics Teacher Training Scholarship](https://ima.org.uk/support/mathematics-teacher-training-scholarship/) (maths) and the [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/iop-teacher-training-scholarships#gref) (physics).

### Non-graduate bursaries

If you're a final year undergraduate student, you may be eligible for a [training bursary of £9,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-bursary-funding-manual/initial-teacher-training-bursaries-funding-manual-2021-to-2022-academic-year#undergraduate-bursary). The bursary is available if you're studying a Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) course in secondary maths or physics, or you're studying an opt-in QTS course in secondary undergraduate computing, languages, mathematics or physics.

There are [Troops to Teachers](https://www.ucas.com/teaching-option/troops-teachers) tax-free bursaries of £40,000 for former military personel  undertaking  undergraduate degrees leading to QTS in England. You may be eligible for the bursary if you train to teach secondary biology, physics, chemistry, computing, maths or modern foreign languages.
