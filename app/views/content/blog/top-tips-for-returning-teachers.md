If you’re thinking of returning to the classroom, now could be a great time. After a period of disruption for so many pupils, you could help those most affected to get back on track. Bring your valuable experience back to the classroom with help from the Department for Education.

## Read up on how things have changed since you were last in the classroom

The Department for Education are working with schools to take action in a number of areas to address issues that teachers may face. From [workload reduction](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit), to [pupil behaviour](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs), [wellbeing](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-staff-wellbeing-charter) and [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools), you may find that the classroom looks very different from when you last taught.

It’s also a good idea to read up on the latest [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) and review changes to the [curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/topic/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications).

## Get free one-to-one support

If you have [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) and want to return to teach at a secondary school in England, you're eligible for a [return to teaching adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) (RTTA). You can get personalised guidance and support from an experienced teaching professional.

From helping you to brush up on your subject knowledge to preparing for interviews, our advisers will be with you every step of the way and help you get back in the classroom.

## Not sure about a full return just yet? Consider the National Tutoring Programme

The National Tutoring Programme supports schools to close the attainment gap in light of the coronavirus pandemic and provides two different options to return to a school environment without taking on a full-time or part-time classroom role.

If you’re unsure about taking on a teaching role at this time, consider applying to tutor or mentor through the [National Tutoring Programme](https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/).

## Make the most of support available online

Check to see if there are any upcoming [online events](/events) for returning teachers. Look up podcasts and articles on education to help familiarise yourself with current issues.

## Set up job alerts through the Teaching Vacancies service

Once you have made the decision to return to teaching what’s the best way of finding that full or part-time role? The Department for Education’s [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/) job-listing service lets you search for roles in your area, filtering results by job role, education phase and working pattern. You can also set up alerts so you’re the first to know about new opportunities.

Remember though that teacher recruitment goes in cycles, with most teaching roles being advertised from January onwards. Setting up a job alert will mean you don’t miss out on your perfect role.
