We recently surveyed over 2,000 of the working population in England to explore their views on what they can bring to the workplace and the extent to which people feel they can be their true selves.

Over one in five (22%) surveyed don’t feel they can be their true self in their current job or career; rising to nearly a third (30%) of Gen Z working adults[^1] – those aged between 18 and 23 – with more than four fifths (85%) of this age group saying they feel more at ease expressing their individuality outside of work[^2].

Yet more than two thirds (69%) of all the working adults surveyed agree that expressing their individuality at work would allow them to be more satisfied with the job they’re doing[^3], and an overwhelming (90%) feel it’s important to be able to express their unique individuality in daily life[^4]. 

To coincide with the research findings, a new trend and insight-driven think-piece titled ‘[Future Perspective: Why Gen Z could be great for the classroom](https://leoconsults.com/docs/Why-GenZ-Could-Be-Great-For-The-Classroom.pdf)’ has been released by independent cultural forecaster Leo Sanders. In it, Leo explores five current cultural and popular trends which are actively influencing the lives of Generation Z, examining what sets this generation apart and why the talents today’s undergraduates possess could align with a career in teaching.

Commenting on the findings, English teacher Chloe Carrubba, 24, said:

> Like other jobs, teaching can be hard work, but I can bring my whole self to work, and nothing beats knowing that you’re having a lasting impact on young people’s lives. 
>
> What I’m most proud of is being able to bring all elements of myself to my career. Teaching allows me to encompass my life and educational experience and bring it into a classroom which, hopefully, nurtures and educates young people in an inspiring, dynamic, and ultimately human way.
