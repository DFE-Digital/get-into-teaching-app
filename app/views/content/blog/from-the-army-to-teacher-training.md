I've served 23 years in the British Army. My most recent role has been the lead exercise rehabilitation instructor within the lower limbs team at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre.

I saw a Get Into Teaching advertisement on TV and decided to investigate. I signed up for a free [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers) and worked with my adviser Elaine for over 3 months.

Contact with Elaine was frequent, and she was able to fit calls in at short notice when I had an interview — a lot sooner than expected. The initial discussion with Elaine was to see what qualifications I had, what area of education I would like to pursue and information about what local university and initial teacher training providers were looking for from candidates.

She offered advice on [getting classroom experience](/is-teaching-right-for-me/get-school-experience) and gave me recommendations for contacting schools and training providers. The area of support which I felt I benefitted most from was with writing the personal statement and preparation for the interviews with practice questions.

I was invited to all 3 interviews and subsequently gained a place. I’m lucky as my wife is a teacher and she also offered advice relating to the interview process.

I can’t speak highly enough of Elaine and the assistance given by the Get Into Teaching service. I'm looking forward to starting my primary PGCE with PE specialisation at Sheffield Hallam University.
