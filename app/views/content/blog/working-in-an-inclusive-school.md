## Why did you want to work in a school?

I have always loved immersing myself in finding ways of making learning accessible to adults and children alike, and have considered pursuing teaching for quite a while. I thought working as a teaching assistant (TA) would be a great start, and I love how every day is different and provides new challenges and rewards.

My role is to support students with special educational needs to make sure what they are taught and what assessments and learning tasks they are expected to do are differentiated to best allow them to succeed

## How did you feel about coming out before starting your role?

It was actually a bit of a spur of the moment thing. Most of my previous work history was spent either closeted or mentioning that I was non-binary to a select few co-workers. I was new to navigating how to clearly request that my identity be recognised and was quite nervous about it, so I planned to start my job and assess how comfortable it would be for me to come out at a later date.

However, when I attended my interview I decided it would be much more practical if I started off on the right foot, and one of the questions I asked was “how would the school support a trans member of staff?” The response I received was immensely positive, and I knew I had made the right choice to be open about my identity from the start.

## How have your colleagues responded?

The school prides itself on equality and inclusion, and this has been felt ever since I started a few months ago. My colleagues are hugely supportive, even when the concept of using a different set of pronouns (singular they/their) and a new title (I use the honorific Mx, pronounced ‘Mix’) has been unfamiliar.

I try to be clear that I am not offended when slip-ups happen as I know it can take some getting used to, and when it does happen my colleagues often either self-correct or are comfortable correcting each other. I am immensely lucky that my co-workers have always been gracious and apologetic about mistakes when they do happen.

## How have the students responded?

The students have been absolutely brilliant — I try to introduce myself at the beginning of lessons with unfamiliar class groups, clearly explaining my pronouns and title and how to use them, and this goes a long way to help them remember. I then often allow open questions so that the students can feel more at ease and curious learning about how trans people navigate gender and society, as well as reassuring them that they won’t offend me if they accidentally get it wrong.

The result has been that the students are eager to greet me around the school, and will happily correct each other and even other members of staff when people accidentally use the wrong title or pronouns. It is worth noting that many of them have trans friends or indeed are exploring gender themselves, and are often already very knowledgeable on trans issues and etiquette.

> I am continuously amazed by the kind of insightful questions I get.

## Have there been any challenges/surprises?

Every day is something new. One of the things that has surprised me is that it is usually the year sevens that have been the most accepting and knowledgeable about trans issues, while the older year groups tend to find it a bit confusing at first to understand — although they are no less open to learn. I am also continuously amazed by the kind of insightful questions I get — I have been asked by students about the logistics of navigating public spaces and utilities as a trans person, how I deal with bigotry and transphobic harassment, and how I discovered I was trans.

I have been asked amusing but very good questions like “does you gender change throughout the week?” and difficult questions such as “how do I come out?” that really highlight how important it is for students to have LGBT+ role models in school. When I was young and gender non-conforming I didn’t even have access to the right language to define myself, and it was unthinkable to me that I could be taught by someone who shared my experiences, so I find myself immensely honoured and sometimes even overwhelmed that I am able to fill that role and what that might mean for the students I teach.

## Do you have any advice for aspiring/current school staff who may be concerned about sharing certain aspects of their lives at work?

Do your research about the schools you are considering working with. They may have had previous positive or negative media presence surrounding LGBT+ issues, or information on their website detailing how the school supports and uplifts LGBT+ students, staff and history.

During the process of application and induction it is a good idea to inform your employer as soon as possible of your name, title and pronouns so that you won’t have the ordeal of correcting paperwork later.

When working with children, it’s important to not misconstrue their transphobia as malicious. We live in a transphobic society and most of their knowledge on LGBT+ issues and culture will be incomplete or out of context from what they may have found online. While it is hard, I always tell myself that the first time I hear something transphobic that it will often be out of ignorance, and that it is in a way my responsibility as a transgender teacher to give students a chance to challenge their assumptions and ask questions, and allow them to unlearn the bigotry that they have repeated without fully understanding. Sometimes giving them the benefit of further explanation and patience isn’t enough, and when dealing with abuse and disrespect from your students it is essential that you know you are supported by your school and that it is dealt with appropriately.
