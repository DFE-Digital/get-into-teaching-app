## What inspired you to become a teacher?

I was very good at maths at school but loved physics and so a career in engineering seemed the obvious choice to make the most of my skill set.

I thoroughly enjoyed my degree and my first role in industry as a production engineer in a cooker factory, designing the production lines and training staff how to put together these complex appliances.

Promotion, however, took me away from the practical engineering role and more into the politics of big business and I no longer enjoyed what I was doing.

I tried many things from decorating, gardening and even running a wine bar until I realised that working with young people, enjoying their successes, and helping them develop skills truly inspired me and so I applied for a PGCE at Leicester University.

As soon as I set foot in the classroom, I knew it was for me. There were nerves and I didn’t enjoy presenting in assemblies to start with but in the classroom with the students I enjoyed the academic and management challenge. I also enjoyed the company of highly educated staff with whom intellectual discussions were common.

Over the next few years my experience in the engineering industry helped me develop my career. Following spells as assistant head of year and head of physics, I moved schools to become head of science. I wrote the bid for the school to become a science college and when the school opened a sixth form, I took on the role as head of sixth form.

In the last few years, I have been a senior leader in charge of careers and STEM. I now work part time in school and have developed further roles working for the Royal Academy of Engineering, The Ogden Trust and STEM Learning.

## Why do you think it is important that engineering and technology are taught to children in education?

The future of the country, and the planet, is becoming more and more dependent on highly STEM educated individuals who can identify the problems we face and hopefully develop solutions.

As educators, we have a duty to help students achieve these positions, but we also need to produce a population of STEM literate citizens who understand the issues and can appreciate the need to make changes in their own lives to help others and the planet.

They will understand the importance of the role of engineering and technology in the future of their community, country, and the planet as a whole. Children will realise that they have the skills necessary to be involved in the solutions to some of the problems that they will face and will pursue careers in engineering and technology. 

Highlighting that every industry is heavily dependent on engineering will inspire them to study hard in the relevant areas of the curriculum allowing them to become future leaders in engineering and technology.

## As an engineering and technologist, you converted to a teaching career – would you encourage others to do the same? 

I would thoroughly recommend teaching to other engineers. The intellectual challenge is very high, not so much in understanding the content, but how to impart your knowledge to others who may not be as keen to learn as previous colleagues.

Classroom management is a real opportunity to utilise creative problem-solving methods that have an immediate impact and can change the lives of young people.

## How is having an engineering background beneficial to teaching children? 

Children enjoy challenges and solving problems. Coming from an engineering background where the day-to-day job is exactly that means we can be on the same wavelength as the students.

The engineering habits of mind can be used to effectively challenge student both academically and behaviourally and set lessons up to encourage problem solving. Where students can define the challenge themselves and become more independent is vital for their future success, encouraging and engineering approach in lessons will help to develop this.

I have a wealth of real-world examples to fall back on when teaching about maths or physics, its relevance, how interesting and challenging it can be and the euphoria of successfully cracking a difficult problem or managing a team that completes a major project. Having enough experience to answer the perennial question, “Why do we need to learn this?” is invaluable.

## It may be daunting for someone to switch to a teaching role - are skills easily transferable from engineer/technician to teacher? 

I believe every experience prior to going into teaching adds to the skills that are essential for the role. Engineering skills are particularly suited as there will always be new problems to overcome and engineers are trained to find solutions to challenging problems.

Thinking on your feet and not getting flustered whilst leading a group is essential and I can think of many occasions as an engineer when others were looking to me for guidance, expertise and decision making. Students are not dissimilar in that they look at a teacher as the expert in the room.

I have found the skills I learnt in engineering have stood me in good stead for a teaching career, I have never regretted my decision to go into this profession.
