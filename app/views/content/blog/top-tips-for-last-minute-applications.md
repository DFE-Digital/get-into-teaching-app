Are you thinking of training to become a teacher? Well, the good news is that there’s still time to apply for a place starting this autumn. If you’re organised and get started on your application right away, you could be out in schools making a difference as a trainee teacher in a matter of weeks!

These top tips from Teacher Training Adviser Jane Wilkinson will help you put together a strong application fast. The final deadline for UCAS applications is 7 September 2020 — so what are you waiting for?

1. Use the find teacher training tool and school websites to do some research and find a few teacher training providers you like the look of, then call them to check whether they are still considering applications.

2. Fill in your UCAS application as you go — this is often more efficient than trying to do it all at once. Some parts, such as details of the exam boards for your GCSEs, can take time to find, so start filling in the easy bits in the meantime.

3. Keep your personal statement simple. Stick to why you want to be a teacher, how your skills and attributes will help you become an outstanding teacher and what you’ve learnt from any time you’ve spent observing in a school.

4. Have your CV to hand to remind you of what to put in the school and work experience section. Make sure you list all the places you’ve worked, including any relevant voluntary jobs or classroom observations.

5. Brief your referees. You can’t send your application until both your references have been submitted, so this is vital! Make sure that they’re expecting the reference request and understand that time is of the essence. You could also remind them of why you’d make a great teacher.

6. If your referees are delaying your application, speed up the process by sending a copy of your application directly to teacher training providers. Explain in your covering email that your UCAS form will follow as soon as your references are complete.

7. Take the time to practise your interview techniques with a friend or family member. Remember your non-verbal communications are as important and the words you choose.

8. Start your student finance application right away — there’s no need to wait until your teacher training place has been confirmed. Don’t worry about applying for a bursary though, as your teacher training provider will sort this out for you if you are eligible.

9. Register on the Get into Teaching website for a Teacher Training Adviser to get free help and support from someone who knows the application process inside and out. They will get you through the process as quickly as possible and help you write a really strong application.
