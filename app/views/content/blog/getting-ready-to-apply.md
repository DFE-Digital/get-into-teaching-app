Applications for teacher training courses starting in 2023 open on 11 October, but there is plenty you can be doing right now to get ready.

## 1. Check your eligibility

Before you apply for teacher training you’ll need to make sure you’re eligible. Although different training providers may have specific recruitment criteria, there are some basic eligibility requirements you’ll need to meet to become a teacher in England.

[Check your eligibility](/steps-to-become-a-teacher).

## 2. Get personalised guidance to your inbox

Get one step closer to the classroom with guidance tailored to you, including how to get:

* a taste of teaching
* funding to train
* one-to-one support
* advice from trainees or recently qualified teachers

[Sign up for personalised guidance in your inbox](/mailinglist/signup/name).

## 3. Get a Teacher Training Adviser

An experienced teaching professional can help you if you're (one of the following):

* ready to get into teaching
* returning to teach at a secondary school in England and already have qualified teacher status (QTS)

[Get an adviser](/tta-service).

## 4. Research training courses

[Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/). You can search by location, training provider and subject to find the course best suited to you.

## 5. Reflect on (or get some) school experience

Demonstrating how any voluntary time you have spent in school has shaped your view of teaching is vital to a good application. If you haven’t managed to get some time in a school yet, some schools are offering the opportunity for candidates to undertake school experience both in school and virtually.

[Search for schools and apply for school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/).

If you’re an undergraduate student interested in teaching physics, maths, computing or modern languages, you might also be able to apply for some paid teaching experience. Find out how you might be eligible for a [teaching internship](/teaching-internship-providers).

## 6. Start lining up your references

You’ll need a couple of people who can give you a reference when you apply. They'll confirm how they know you and if they know any reason why you should not work with children.

If a training provider offers you a place and you accept, they'll use your references to find out more about you.

 Find out more about [choosing your references](/train-to-be-a-teacher/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training#choose-your-references).

## 7. Get some advice at an event

Our Train to Teach events will provide you with a wealth of information and help you turn questions to confidence on your journey to the classroom. At some of our Train to Teach events you can meet a whole range of local training providers; at others you’ll have the chance to put your questions to a panel of experts. Some events are in person and others replicate the experience online. [Book your place at a Train to Teach event](/events/about-train-to-teach-events).

## 8.  Join our support networks

Our Facebook groups for [aspiring teachers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1357146377672255/) and people thinking of a [career change to teaching](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CareerChangetoTeaching/) offer a really friendly, supportive place to connect with other people applying for teacher training and ask any questions you might have.
