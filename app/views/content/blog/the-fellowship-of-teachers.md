There’s another side to teaching that only the teachers can tell you about. While you’ll spend a lot of your time in the classroom with the students, you’ll also become part of a tight-knit team of teachers just like you. You’ll find camaraderie, support, make lifelong friendships and, of course, have a lot of fun. So, to give you the low down on what goes on outside the classroom, we’ve asked fellow teachers Mike Halton and Phil Young to share their experiences. 

## What’s your school culture like?

Mike: All our colleagues are very supportive. If you've had a hard day, there’s always someone there to listen - even if it's just a two-minute natter or moan. 
 
## What goes on outside the classroom?

Phil: We all get on really well, we’re like a big family (excuse the corniness).  We do curry nights every month where we go out and put the world to rights. 

Mike: We’ve started a running club recently, and we’ve gone to football matches together too. 
 
## What about during the pandemic?

Phil: We really look out for each other. I formed a bubble with one of the other teachers who was living alone during last year’s lockdown. We had games nights and formed a strong friendship during that time.
 
## Best part of your day?

Phil: Seeing the students arrive and knowing they can’t wait to get to my class. There’s no feeling like it. 

Mike: Lunch!! No, just kidding … Every day is different, so I never know what’s really going to happen, that’s what makes it great. 
 
## What have you learnt from your colleagues?

Mike: My teaching assistant suggested giving out different badges at the end of each day to reward kids for showing characteristics like respect or self-belief or honesty. They love it – they’ve really latched onto the idea!
 
## Dare we ask, who’s stricter?

Mike: I think Phil is probably more vigilant than me…

Phil: Underneath it I’m a big softie though!
 
## Advice to someone thinking about becoming a teacher?

Phil: I know a lot of people wrestle with the idea for a while, and think, do I take this step? There’s always something that could hold you back, but you've got to have the courage to make the jump. I promise the level of satisfaction is like nothing you’ll get in another job. I wake up every morning and want to get into school.
