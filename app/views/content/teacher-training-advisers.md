## How does it work?

You’ll be matched with your own dedicated adviser. You’ll have the same adviser throughout your journey into teaching.

How often you talk to them is up to you – this could be every week for more than a year, or just a few times for some one-to-one support.

You can chat by phone, or by:

* email
* text
* WhatsApp

## How can your adviser help you?

### If teaching is just an idea

Your adviser can talk to you about what teaching is really like and help you understand if it’s right for you.

They can:

* talk through your questions and any doubts ​
* help you find school experience
* explain the steps to becoming a teacher

### If you're thinking about returning to teaching

Your adviser can help you understand how to get back into teaching if you already have qualified teacher status (QTS).

They can help you:

* brush up on your subject knowledge
* find a role

## Can I get an adviser?

To sign up, you’ll need (one of the following):

* a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
* to be a final year student studying for a bachelor’s degree with honours
* an overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher

If you’re a returning teacher who already has qualified teacher status (QTS), you'll need to be returning to teach at a secondary school in England to get an adviser.

If you completed your degree overseas, you can check your qualifications by <a href="tel:08003892500">calling us on 0800 389 2500</a>.
