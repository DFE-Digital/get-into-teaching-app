Teacher training advisers give you free, one-to-one support, wherever you are on your journey into teaching.

They have years of teaching experience and can answer all your questions about life in the classroom, as well as how you can get there.

## How does it work?

You’ll be matched with your own dedicated adviser. You’ll have the same adviser throughout your journey into teaching.
How you talk to them is up to you – you can chat through:

* email
* phone
* text

You can talk to them as little or as often as you need. This could be every week for a year, or just a few times before making an application.

## How your adviser can help you

## Can I get an adviser?

To sign up, you’ll need (one of the following):

* to be a final year student studying for a bachelor’s degree with honours
* an overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
