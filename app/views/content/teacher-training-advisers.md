## Can I get an adviser?

To sign up, you’ll need to have or be in your final year of studying for a bachelor's degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher (or an equivalent).

If you're already a qualified teacher, you'll need English qualified teacher status (QTS) and want to teach a secondary subject.

If you got your qualifications outside the UK, <a href="tel:08003892500">call us on 0800 389 2500 to check if you're eligible</a>.
