Teacher training advisers give you free, one-to-one help and support. 

They're all former teachers with lots of experience, so they know the process inside out.

## What an adviser can do for you

$q-tta-one$

Wherever you are in your journey into teaching, an adviser can give you as much or as little help as you need. 

Other trainee teachers say they are particularly helpful with: 

* arranging school experience
* seeking out financial support
* writing a personal statement
* preparing for interviews

Our advisers can help you at any time, even if you're a year or more away from applying.

## Helping you decide if teaching is right for you

$q-tta-two$

Teaching is an exciting career, but if you have caring responsibilities, people dependent on your earnings, or you are living with a disability you might need some help to take your next step. 

Your adviser can help you navigate your path into teaching, and make sure you get any additional help that is available. Your adviser will be just a call, message or email away.

## Are you ready for an adviser? 

To sign up, you’ll need (one of the following):

* a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
* to be studying for a bachelor’s degree with honours, with a predicted grade of 2:2 or higher
* an overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
