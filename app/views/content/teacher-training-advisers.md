Teacher training advisers give you free, one-to-one help and support. 

They're all former teachers with lots of experience, so they know the process inside out.

## What an adviser can do for you

$q-tta-one$

An adviser can give you as much or as little help as you need. 

Other trainee teachers say they are particularly helpful with: 

* arranging school experience
* seeking out financial support
* writing a personal statement
* preparing for interviews

## Helping you decide if teaching is right for you

$q-tta-two$

Teaching is an exciting career, but if you have caring responsibilities, people dependent on your earnings, or you are living with a disability you might need some help to take your next step. 

Your adviser can help you navigate your path into teaching, and make sure you get any additional help that is available. Your adviser will be just a call, message or email away.

## Already applied and been unsuccessful?

Our advisers can help make your next application stronger. They’ll help you:

* act on any feedback
* understand the qualifications you need to become a teacher
* improve your personal statement

## Are you ready for an adviser? 

To sign up, you’ll need (one of the following):

* a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher
* to be a final year student studying for a bachelor’s degree with honours, with a predicted grade of 2:2 or higher
* an overseas qualification equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with honours, grade 2:2 or higher

If you're applying from overseas, you can check your qualifications by calling us on <a href="tel:08003892500">0800 389 2500</a>.

If you’re a returning teacher who already has qualified teacher status (QTS), you'll need to be returning to teach at a secondary school in England to get an adviser.

If you're a veteran, you can get an adviser with or without a degree.
