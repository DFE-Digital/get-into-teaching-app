If you have children or other caring responsibilities, you may be able to get extra financial support while training to teach.

You do not have to pay this money back, and you’ll get it on top of your other student finance.

Figures are for the 2024/25 academic year.

There are full and part-time teacher training courses available, but you must be doing a full-time course to be eligible for the funding options on this page. If you’re doing a part-time course, you may be eligible for [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-students).

## If you're a parent

If you’re a parent, you may be eligible for:

 * a Childcare Grant
 * the Parents’ Learning Allowance

### Childcare Grant

A Childcare Grant could help you with your childcare costs. The amount you could receive will depend on your household income and the number of children who are dependent on you.

You could get 85% of your childcare costs or a fixed maximum amount, whichever is less.

The maximum you can get is:

* up to $finance_childcaregrantweeklypayment_one$ a week for 1 child
* up to $finance_childcaregrantweeklypayment_twoplus$ a week for 2 or more children

Grants are paid into a Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS) account. Your childcare provider would then be paid directly from this account.

To be eligible, you need to:

* be a full-time higher education student
* have children under 15 (or 17 if they have special educational needs)
* be eligible for student finance

### Parents’ Learning Allowance

The Parents’ Learning Allowance could help you with your learning costs if you’re a full-time student with children.

You could be eligible for between $finance_parentslearningallowance_min$ and $finance_parentslearningallowance_max$ a year, depending on your household income.

This is usually paid to you in 3 instalments, one at the start of each term.

To be eligible, you need to:

* be doing a full-time undergraduate course or a teacher training course in England
* have dependent children
* have a household income of less than $finance_parentslearningallowance_income$ a year

* your household income
* the adult dependant’s income
* your personal circumstances (for example, if you’re married or have children)
* what other grants you’re receiving (for example, a Childcare Grant)

This is usually paid to you in 3 instalments, one at the start of each term.

To be eligible, you need to:

* be a full-time student in higher education
* have an adult depend on you financially
* have a household income of less than $finance_adultdependantsgrant_income$
