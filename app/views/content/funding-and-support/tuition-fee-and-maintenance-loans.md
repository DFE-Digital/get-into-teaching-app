Funding is available to help you train to teach if you choose a course that has tuition fees. You may be eligible for a student loan to cover the cost of your tuition fees or to help with your living costs.

You can still apply for a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan if:

* you also get a teaching bursary or scholarship

* you've previously applied for and received a student loan

You'll only have to make loan repayments once you’re earning.

You do not need to wait until you have a confirmed offer for a teacher training course to apply for student funding.

If you choose a teacher training course that has a salary you're not eligible for any student finance.

## Tuition fee loan

$loan-increase$

You can apply for a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of your postgraduate teacher training course. If you’re eligible for a tuition fee loan, the amount you borrow is paid directly to your course provider.

The maximum tuition fee loan for postgraduate teacher training for a UK applicant is:

* $finance_tuitionfeeloan_postgraduatemaxfulltime$ per year for a full-time course
* $finance_tuitionfeeloan_postgraduatemaxparttime$ per year for a part-time course

The maximum amount you can borrow depends on how much your course costs.

Tuition fee loans are not means tested. So you do not need to provide evidence of your income or anyone else’s to be eligible to receive one.

## Maintenance loan

$maintenance-increase$

You may also be eligible for a maintenance loan to help cover your living costs.

The maximum amount you may be eligible to borrow is:

* $finance_maintenanceloan_withparents$ if you live at home with your parents
* $finance_maintenanceloan_notwithparentsoutsidelondon$ if you live away from home and are studying outside of London
* $finance_maintenanceloan_notwithparentsinsidelondon$ if you live away from home and are studying in London
* $finance_maintenanceloan_oversixty$ if you're 60 years or over on the first day of the first academic year of your course

## Check your eligibility for a bursary or scholarship

You may also be eligible for a tax-free bursary or scholarship, depending on the subject you're training to teach.

You do not have to pay a bursary or scholarship back. You can get a bursary or scholarship as well as any tuition fee loan and maintenance loan.
