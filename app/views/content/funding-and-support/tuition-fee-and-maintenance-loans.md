Funding is available to help you train to teach. You may be eligible for a student loan to cover the cost of your tuition fees or to help with your living costs. 

You can still apply for a tuition fee and a maintenance loan if you already have a student loan, and regardless of whether you get a teaching bursary or scholarship.

You can apply for student funding online and you do not need to wait until you have a confirmed offer to apply for student funding. 

## Tuition fee loans
You can apply for a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of your postgraduate teacher training course so you do not have to pay your course fees upfront. If you’re eligible for a tuition fee loan the amount you borrow is paid directly to your course provider.

* £9,250 is the maximum tuition fee loan available for a full-time postgraduate teacher training course for UK applicants. The maximum amount you can borrow depends on how much your course costs. 

Tuition fees loans are not means tested, so you do not need to provide evidence of yours or anyone else’s income to be eligible to receive one.

## Maintenance loans
You may also be eligible for a maintenance loan to help you cover your living expenses. The amount you can borrow depends on if you: 

* live at home with your parents 
* live somewhere else 
* live in London 
* are 60 years or over on the first day of the academic year 

maintenance loan of up to £13,022  to help with living costs


You will only have to make loan repayments once you’re earning.

You’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body to find out about your eligibility for funding if you live in Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland.

Or, you'll need to contact the education authority if you live in Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.

### Non-UK citizens

If you’re not a UK citizen, you are unlikely to get help funding your training unless you have permission to [live permanently in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk), for example under the EU Settlement Scheme, or are training to teach languages or physics. You will also need to meet some other eligibility requirements.

## Check your eligibility for a scholarship or bursary

You may also be eligible for a scholarship or bursary, depending on the subject you're training to teach.

You do not have to pay a scholarship or bursary back. You can receive this as well as any tuition fee and maintenance loans.

Find out if you're eligible for a [scholarship or bursary](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries).
