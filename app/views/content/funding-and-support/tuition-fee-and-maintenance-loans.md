Funding is available to help you train to teach if you choose a course that has tuition fees. You may be eligible for a student loan to cover the cost of your tuition fees or to help with your living costs.

The amounts on this page are for the $finance_loanacademicyear$.

You can still apply for a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan if:

* you also get a teaching bursary or scholarship

* you've previously applied for and received a student loan

You'll only have to make loan repayments once you’re earning.

You do not need to wait until you have a confirmed offer for a teacher training course to apply for student funding.

If you choose a teacher training course that has a salary you're not eligible for any student finance.

## Tuition fee loan

You can apply for a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of your postgraduate teacher training course. If you’re eligible for a tuition fee loan, the amount you borrow is paid directly to your course provider.

The maximum tuition fee loan for postgraduate teacher training for a UK applicant starting a course in the 2026 to 2027 academic year was:

* $finance_tuitionfeeloan_postgraduatemaxfulltime$ per year for a full-time course
* $finance_tuitionfeeloan_postgraduatemaxparttime$ per year for a part-time course

Maximum tuition fee loan amounts are linked to the maximum tuition fees training providers can charge. Maximum tuition fees are set by the UK government.

The maximum amount you can borrow depends on how much your course costs.

Tuition fee loans are not means tested. So you do not need to provide evidence of your income or anyone else’s to be eligible to receive one.

## Maintenance loan

You may also be eligible for a maintenance loan to help cover your living costs.

The maximum amount you may be eligible to borrow is:

* $finance_maintenanceloan_withparents$ if you live at home with your parents
* $finance_maintenanceloan_notwithparentsoutsidelondon$ if you live away from home and are studying outside of London
* $finance_maintenanceloan_notwithparentsinsidelondon$ if you live away from home and are studying in London
* $finance_maintenanceloan_oversixty$ if you're 60 years or over on the first day of the first academic year of your course

## Check your eligibility for a bursary or scholarship

You may also be eligible for a tax-free bursary or scholarship, depending on the subject you're training to teach.

You do not have to pay a bursary or scholarship back. You can get a bursary or scholarship as well as any tuition fee loan and maintenance loan.

## Other financial support

### Financial support if you have a disability or other health condition

If you’re neurodiverse, have a long-term physical or mental health condition, or have any other accessibility needs, you may be eligible for extra financial support to become a teacher.

This support can help to cover the costs of any specialist equipment or study-related costs due to a health condition or disability.

$disability-support$

### Financial support if you're a parent or carer

If you have children or other caring responsibilities, you may be able to get extra financial support while training to teach.

$parents-carers-support$

### Financial support if you're a veteran 

If you’re transitioning from the armed forces or your service has already ended, you could be eligible for support to train to teach.
