Funding is available to help you train to teach. You can apply for a:

- tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover your teacher training, so you do not need to pay course fees upfront
- maintenance loan of up to £12,667 to help with living costs

You can still apply for a tuition fee and a maintenance loan if you already have a student loan, and regardless of whether you get a teaching bursary or scholarship.

You will only have to make loan repayments once you’re earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take an additional loan for teacher training.

## Check your eligibility for a scholarship or bursary

You may also be eligible for a scholarship or bursary, depending on the subject you're training to teach.

You do not have to pay a scholarship or bursary back. You'll receive this as well as your tuition fee and maintenance loans.
