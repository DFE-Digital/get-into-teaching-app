## Undergraduate bursaries

You may be eligible for a [bursary of £9,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2023-to-2024#undergraduate-bursary) if you do a secondary maths or physics course that leads to [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/what-is-qts).

You may also be eligible if you do an opt-in QTS course in secondary computing, languages, mathematics or physics. This is where you start a standard undergraduate degree but then opt-in to initial teacher training to get QTS.

The amount you receive depends on the year that you start your QTS course. You do not get a bursary in every year of an undergraduate course. Depending on the type of course you do, you may get the bursary in your final year or final two years.

### Undergraduate bursary if you're former military personnel

You may be eligible for a £40,000 tax-free undergraduate bursary for veterans if you’re:

* training to teach secondary biology, physics, chemistry, computing, maths or languages
* doing an undergraduate degree leading to QTS in England
