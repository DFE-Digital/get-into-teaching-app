## Eligibility for bursaries

You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically receive it.

To be eligible for a bursary, you’ll need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If your course combines 2 subjects (for example, English and history), at least 50% of your course content must be made up of the bursary subject to be eligible.

#### How bursaries are paid

A bursary is paid over a minimum of 10 months by your teacher training provider. They will confirm when you will get the payments. 

You will not need to pay tax or National Insurance on bursary payments. 

#### How to get a bursary

You do not need to apply for a bursary. When you apply for teacher training, your provider will check if you're eligible for a bursary. If you are, your provider will confirm this in writing before you start your course. 

## Eligibility for scholarships

To be eligible for a scholarship, you’ll need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:1 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If you achieved a 2:2 in your degree, you may still be eligible. You would need to show you have enough relevant experience and subject knowledge. 

As scholarships are awarded by independent organisations, they set their own assessment requirements and application deadlines.

They offer more than just financial benefits. For example, they can provide professional body membership, subject-specific support, mentoring, events and classroom resources.
