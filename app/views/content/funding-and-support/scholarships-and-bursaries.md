### Bursaries

You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically receive it.

To be eligible for a bursary, you’ll need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If your course combines 2 subjects (for example, English and history), at least 50% of your course content must be made up of the bursary subject to be eligible.

If your course combines 2 subjects where bursaries are awarded (for example, biology and chemistry), you'll receive the highest bursary amount available.

You’ll also need to meet the bursary scheme’s individual terms and conditions.

[Find out more about your eligibility for teaching bursaries](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2023-to-2024).

### Scholarships

To be eligible for a scholarship, you’ll need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:1 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

In exceptional circumstances, if you achieved a 2:2 in your degree you may still be awarded a scholarship if you have significant relevant experience.

Scholarships are offered by independent institutions. They set their own eligibility criteria and you’ll need to apply through the relevant scholarship body:

* [the Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/awards-funding/funding/teacher-training-scholarships/) (chemistry)
* [BCS The Chartered Institute for IT](https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/certification-and-scholarships-for-teachers/bcs-computer-teacher-scholarships/) (computing)
* [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.org/) (languages -- French, German and Spanish only)
* [the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications](http://teachingmathsscholars.org/about) (maths)
* [the Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/iop-teacher-training-scholarships#gref) (physics)

## Undergraduate bursaries

You may be eligible for a [bursary of £9,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2023-to-2024#undergraduate-bursary) if you do a secondary maths or physics course that leads to [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/what-is-qts).

You may also be eligible if you do an opt-in QTS course in secondary computing, languages, mathematics or physics. This is where you start a standard undergraduate degree but then opt-in to initial teacher training to get QTS.

The amount you receive depends on the year that you start your QTS course. You do not get a bursary in every year of an undergraduate course. Depending on the type of course you do, you may get the bursary in your final year or final two years.

### Undergraduate bursary if you're former military personnel

You may be eligible for a £40,000 tax-free undergraduate bursary for veterans if you’re:

* training to teach secondary biology, physics, chemistry, computing, maths or languages
* doing an undergraduate degree leading to QTS in England
