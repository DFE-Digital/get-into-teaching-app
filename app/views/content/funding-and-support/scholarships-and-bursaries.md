## Eligibility for bursaries

You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically receive it.

You must be eligible for student finance to receive a bursary (unless you’re training to teach physics or languages). You'll also need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If your course combines 2 subjects (for example, English and history), at least 50% of your course content must be made up of the bursary subject to be eligible.

### How bursaries are paid

A bursary is paid over a minimum of 10 months by your teacher training provider across the duration of your course. They will confirm when you will get the payments. 

You will not need to pay tax or National Insurance on bursary payments. 

You do not have to pay a bursary back.

### How to get a bursary

You do not need to apply for a bursary. When you apply for teacher training, your provider will check if you're eligible for a bursary. If you are, your provider will confirm this in writing before you start your course. 

## Eligibility for scholarships

You must be eligible for student finance to receive a scholarship (unless you’re training to teach physics or languages). You’ll also need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:1 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If you achieved a 2:2 in your degree, you may still be eligible. You would need to show you have enough relevant experience and subject knowledge. 

Scholarships are awarded by independent organisations which set their own assessment requirements.

Scholarships offer more than just financial benefits. For example, they can provide professional body membership, subject-specific support, mentoring, events and classroom resources. 

### How scholarships are paid

## Other funding options

If you're not eligible for a bursary or scholarship, there may be other funding options available, such as [tuition fees and maintenance loans](/funding-and-support/tuition-fees).

You may be eligible for [a salaried teacher training course](/funding-and-support/salaried-teacher-training) which means you'll get paid while you train to teach. Some salaried teacher training courses may also come with fees. Check with individual providers for more information. 

For advice on funding, you can speak to a [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers). They can help you work out what support you could be eligible for.
