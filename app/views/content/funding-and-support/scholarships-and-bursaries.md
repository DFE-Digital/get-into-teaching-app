## Bursaries

You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically receive it.

To be eligible for a bursary, you’ll need at least one of the following:

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:2 (honours) or higher
* a master’s degree
* a PhD

If your course combines 2 subjects (for example, English and history), at least 50% of your course content must be made up of the bursary subject to be eligible.

You’ll also need to meet the bursary scheme’s individual terms and conditions.

[Find out more about your eligibility for teaching bursaries](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2024-to-2025).

## Scholarships

Scholarships are provided by charitable organisations with a passion for their subject area.  

They offer more than just financial benefits. For example, you can get mentoring, subject specialist events, or access to networking events.

#### Eligibility

* a bachelor’s degree class 2:1 (honours) or higher

Scholarship providers set their own:
