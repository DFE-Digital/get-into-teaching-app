There are some teacher training courses that come with a salary. 

This means you will not have to pay tuition fees and will receive a salary while you train to get [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts). This is what you need to teach in many primary, secondary and special schools in England. 

The main salaried courses include School Direct salaried, postgraduate teaching apprenticeships (PGTA) and teacher training delivered by Teach First.

All salaried courses are broadly the same, but the course length and qualifications you work towards may vary.

These courses are in high demand and very competitive, so it’s important to apply as soon as you can if you’re eligible. 

## Am I eligible for a salaried teacher training course? 

For some salaried courses, teacher training providers may want you to have significant teaching or school experience (for example, if you’re already working as an unqualified teacher or teaching assistant).  

Some also want you to have already arranged a school to work in while you train. Speak to the teacher training provider to find out what their requirements are. 

You can also [find out more about the qualifications you need to apply for all teacher training courses](/is-teaching-right-for-me/qualifications-you-need-to-teach). 

Or talk to a [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers) who can help you understand which courses you could be eligible for. 

## How much will I be paid on a salaried course? 

You'll receive an [unqualified teacher’s salary](/is-teaching-right-for-me/teacher-pay-and-benefits) – the exact amount will vary depending on the school you work in. 

It’s worth checking if there is a [bursary or scholarship](/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries) available for your subject before you apply for a salaried course. 

If you do a salaried course, you will not be eligible for a bursary, scholarship or student finance. You’ll also be taxed on your income, whereas you will not be taxed on a bursary or scholarship. 

If you’re eligible for a bursary or scholarship, you could receive more money on a non-salaried course than on a salaried one. 

## How does salaried teacher training work? 

Salaried teacher training is usually similar to non-salaried teacher training – you'll spend most of your time in school placements, with some theoretical learning. 

You will not perform more than 90% of a full-time teacher’s duties (unless you’re on a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship, in which case it’s 80%). 

Full-time salaried teacher training will usually last: 

* 1 academic year (September to July) if you’re on a School Direct salaried course 

* 2 academic years (September to July) if you’re on a course delivered by Teach First 

* at least 1 full year (September to September) if you’re on a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship – apprenticeships must last a minimum of 12 months 

Some courses can begin at other points in the year and there may be part-time courses available. 

As well as QTS, you may also be able to work towards QTS with a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-a-pgce) or a PGCE, but you may have to pay an extra fee.

## How do I find a salaried teacher training course? 

You can [find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) and filter by salaried courses. 

It’s usually wise to apply for non-salaried courses as well to increase your chances of getting a place on a course.
