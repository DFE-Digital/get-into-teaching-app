If you’re transitioning from the armed forces or your service has already ended, you could be eligible for support to train to teach.

As a veteran, you can bring a unique perspective to teaching by using your organisation, leadership and management skills in the classroom.

There are full and part-time teacher training courses available.

## Undergraduate bursary for veterans

You may be eligible for a tax-free undergraduate bursary of £40,000 if you’re:

* a veteran
* training to teach secondary biology, physics, chemistry, computing, maths or languages
* doing an undergraduate degree leading to [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/what-is-qts) in England

You do not need to apply for a bursary. Your teacher training provider will determine whether you are eligible and will then pay you in monthly instalments across the final two years of your course.

You may also be eligible for a scholarship or bursary if you’re training to teach certain subjects. All teacher training candidates are also eligible for tuition fee and maintenance loans.

[Find out more about funding your training](/funding-and-support).

## Get support

[Veterans UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterans-uk) provides free support and advice for veterans and their families.

[The Career Transition Partnership](https://www.ctp.org.uk/) supports leavers of the armed forces as they transition from the military into civilian life.

The [MOD's Enhanced Learning Credits Scheme (ELC)](https://www.enhancedlearningcredits.com/) promotes lifelong learning amongst members of the armed forces by providing financial support to pay for approved qualifications. You can contact them to find out about eligibility.

## Military equivalent qualifications

You’ll need different qualifications depending on [who you want to teach](/train-to-be-a-teacher/who-do-you-want-to-teach).

If you’re unsure about whether your qualifications achieved through military service meet the standard required, talk to your teacher training provider, or a [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers).

You may also be able to do a top up degree to boost your qualifications to meet the standard required. Talk to your teacher training adviser and provider to find out about your options.
