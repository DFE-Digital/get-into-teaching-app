If you’re transitioning from the armed forces or your service has already ended, you could be eligible for support to train to teach.

As a veteran, you can bring a unique perspective to teaching by using your organisation, leadership and management skills in the classroom.

There are full and part-time teacher training courses available.

## Undergraduate bursary for veterans

You may be eligible for a tax-free undergraduate bursary of $bursaries_veteran_total$ if you are (all of the following):

* a veteran who has left full-time employment with the British Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Navy no more than 5 years before the start of the course
* training to teach secondary biology, chemistry, computing, languages, maths or physics
* doing an undergraduate degree leading to [qualified teacher status (QTS)](/train-to-be-a-teacher/what-is-qts) in England

Doing an undergraduate degree leading to QTS means that you would be qualified to teach in England.

You do not need to apply for a bursary to get one. Your teacher training provider will determine if you're eligible.

You’ll receive $bursaries_veteran_annual$ in each of the last 2 years of your course in equal monthly instalments.

## Postgraduate scholarships and bursaries

You may also be eligible for a postgraduate scholarship or bursary if you’re training to teach certain subjects.

$bursaries$

All teacher training candidates are also eligible for [tuition fee and maintenance loans](/funding-and-support/tuition-fee-and-maintenance-loans).

## Get support

[The Career Transition Partnership website](https://www.modctp.co.uk/) supports leavers of the armed forces as they transition from the military into civilian life.

The [MOD's Enhanced Learning Credits Scheme (ELC) website](https://www.enhancedlearningcredits.com/) promotes lifelong learning amongst members of the armed forces by providing financial support to pay for approved qualifications. You can contact them to find out about eligibility.

Find [support for UK armed forces veterans and their families](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/find-support-for-veterans-and-their-families), including help with finance and employment.

### Get an adviser

You can get free dedicated support from a teacher training adviser and talk to someone just like you who has left the armed forces and gone into teaching.

As a veteran, you can get an adviser with or without a degree.

[Call us on 0800 389 2500](tel:08003892500) to get an adviser.

Our telephone service is available Monday to Friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm, except on [bank holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays).

## Military equivalent qualifications

You’ll need different qualifications depending on [who you want to teach](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/age-groups-you-could-teach).

If you’re unsure about whether your qualifications achieved through military service meet the standard required, talk to your course provider, or a [teacher training adviser](/teacher-training-advisers).

You may also be able to do a top up degree to boost your qualifications to meet the standard required. Talk to your teacher training adviser and course provider to find out about your options.

## Other routes into teaching

You do not need a degree and QTS to [teach in further education](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/further-education-teachers) or to [teach in early years](/life-as-a-teacher/age-groups-and-specialisms/early-years-teachers). So if you want to become a teacher but are not able to get a degree, you can explore these options.
