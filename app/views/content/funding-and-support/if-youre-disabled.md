      If you do not have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain in the UK</a>, you're unlikely to be eligible for this financial support (unless you’ve applied to the Afghan or Ukraine resettlement schemes).

If you’re neurodiverse, have a long-term physical or mental health condition, or have any other accessibility needs, you can get support to become a teacher. This support can sometimes be referred to as training with disabilities and other needs. The support may be helpful to you, even if you do not identify as disabled.

The experience and perspective of a diverse workforce is invaluable in schools, so there’s lots of support available to make sure trainee teachers feel comfortable and confident in the classroom.

## Financial support

### Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)

If you’re on a fee-paying teacher training course, you may be eligible for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA). You cannot get DSA if your course pays a salary. 

DSA can help towards covering any study-related costs you have because of a mental health problem, long term illness or any other disability. You can get DSA on its own or in addition to other student finance. 

It can take up to 14 weeks to get your DSA, so you should take this into consideration if you need the support in place for the start of your course.

### Access to Work

If you get paid for your training, for example, salaried training or a teacher degree apprenticeship, you may be eligible for support through Access to Work. 

Through Access to Work, you can apply for: 

* a grant to help pay for practical support with your work 
* support with managing your mental health at work

Examples could include paying towards accessible transport to get you to school or help with funding specialist equipment.  

Access to Work can also pay for a workplace assessment to see what you need in order to do your job. 

You can apply for Access to Work up to 12 weeks before you start your salaried training or apprenticeship. You should apply as soon as possible if you need the support in place before you start.

## Adjustments to help you train

Teacher training providers can make lots of adjustments so you can attend an interview and complete your teacher training.

## Your rights

Providers must not discriminate against you. They cannot:

- ask disability or health questions if they’re not relevant to your ability to become a teacher
- reject your application because you’re disabled

Anyone who’s offered a place on a teacher training course is asked to complete a fitness questionnaire before starting training. Training providers should only ask relevant questions to make sure you’re able to teach.
