The experience and perspective of a diverse workforce is valued in school culture.

If you’re disabled, have a mental health condition or educational needs, you can get support to become a teacher.

## Disabled Students’ Allowance and other support

Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) is support to cover the study-related costs you have because of a mental health problem, long term illness or any other disability

[Find out more about DSA](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa).

[If you do paid training you may also be eligible for support](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work).

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/about-abilitynet) or [Disability Rights UK](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/adjustments-disabled-students) may also be able to help you identify technology or other adjustments to help you study.

## Adjustments to help you train

Teacher training providers can make adjustments so that you can attend an interview or do the training. For example, they could:

- organise equipment like a hearing loop or an adapted keyboard
- put you in touch with support staff if you have a mental health condition
- make sure classrooms are wheelchair accessible

Sharing that you’re disabled when you [apply for teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training) can help providers make adjustments.

## Your rights

Providers must not discriminate against you. They cannot:

- ask disability or health questions if they’re not relevant to your ability to become a teacher
- reject your application because you’re disabled

Anyone who’s offered a place on a teacher training course is asked to complete a fitness questionnaire before starting training. Training providers should only ask relevant questions to make sure you’re able to teach.
