      If you do not have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain in the UK</a>, you're unlikely to be eligible for this financial support (unless you’ve applied to the Afghan or Ukraine resettlement schemes).

      <p>
      You will still be entitled to adjustments to help you train. Find out about the <a href="/non-uk-teachers/fees-and-funding-for-non-uk-trainees">financial support available for non-UK citizens</a>.</p>

The experience and perspective of a diverse workforce is valued in school culture.

If you’re disabled, have a mental health condition or educational needs, you can get support to become a teacher.

## Financial support

### Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)

You can [apply for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa/how-to-claim) to cover the study-related costs you have because of a mental health problem, long term illness or any other disability.

You’ll get confirmation of whether your application has been successful within 6 weeks.

It can take up to 14 weeks to get your DSA support, so you should take this into consideration if you need the support in place for the start of your course.

### Other funding and support

If you get paid for your training (for example, salaried training or a teacher degree apprenticeship), you may be [eligible for support through Access to Work](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work).

## Adjustments to help you train

Teacher training providers can make adjustments so that you can attend an interview or do the training. For example, they could:

- organise equipment like a hearing loop or an adapted keyboard
- put you in touch with support staff if you have a mental health condition
- make sure classrooms are wheelchair accessible

Sharing that you’re disabled when you [apply for teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-teacher-training) can help providers make adjustments. You should contact your provider to discuss any adjustments you may need.

If you need help to identify technology to help you study, [visit AbilityNet for resources and guides](https://abilitynet.org.uk/about-abilitynet).

You can also explore [Disability Rights UK's guide for disabled students and apprentices](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/).

## Your rights

Providers must not discriminate against you. They cannot:

- ask disability or health questions if they’re not relevant to your ability to become a teacher
- reject your application because you’re disabled

Anyone who’s offered a place on a teacher training course is asked to complete a fitness questionnaire before starting training. Training providers should only ask relevant questions to make sure you’re able to teach.
