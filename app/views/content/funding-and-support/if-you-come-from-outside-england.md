## In the UK

You’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body to find out about your eligibility for funding if you live in Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland.

[Find out about student finance in Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/).

[Find out about student finance in Scotland](https://www.saas.gov.uk/).

[Find out about student finance in Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/).

Or, you'll need to contact the education authority if you live in Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.

## Outside the UK

If you’re not a UK citizen, you are unlikely to get help funding your training unless you have permission to [live permanently in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk), for example under the EU Settlement Scheme. You will also need to meet some other eligibility requirements.
