## In the UK

You’ll need to contact your country’s student finance body to find out about your eligibility for funding if you live in Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland.

Find out about:

* [student finance in Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/)
* [student finance in Scotland](https://www.saas.gov.uk/)
* [student finance in Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/)

Or, you'll need to contact the education authority if you live in Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.

Find out about:

* [funding in Jersey](https://www.gov.je/Working/Careers/16To19YearOlds/EnteringHigherEducation/FinancingHigherEducationCourses/FundingDegreeProfessionalQualifications/Pages/index.aspx)
* [funding in Guernsey](https://www.gov.gg/article/152744/Policies)
* [funding in the Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/student-grants)

## Outside the UK

If you’re not a UK citizen, you are unlikely to get help funding your training unless you have permission to [live permanently in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk), for example under the EU Settlement Scheme. You will also need to meet some other eligibility requirements.
