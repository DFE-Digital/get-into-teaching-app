<div class="content">
  <section class="col col-720">
    <p>Postgraduate bursaries are tax-free payments you receive if you're training to teach certain subjects. You do not need to apply for a bursary, you'll automatically get one if you're eligible.</p>
    <p>Postgraduate scholarships are awarded by organisations with a passion for their subject area. They combine tax-free payments with extra benefits like subject-specific support, mentoring and networking opportunities. If you're eligible, you can apply directly to the scholarship provider.</p>
    <p>You cannot receive both a bursary and a scholarship.</p>
    <p>If you receive either a bursary or a scholarship, you do not need to pay it back.</p>
    <p>Bursaries and scholarships are not available for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>every subject</li>
      <li>salaried teacher training</li>
