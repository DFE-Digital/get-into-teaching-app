  <p>If you want to do postgraduate teacher training in England, you may be eligible for a bursary or scholarship.</p>
<h2 class="heading--box-blue">What are bursaries and scholarships?</h2>
  <p>Bursaries are tax-free payments you receive if you're training to teach certain subjects. If you're eligible for a bursary, you'll get it automatically.</p>
  <p>Scholarships are awarded by organisations with a passion for their subject area. They combine tax-free payments with extra benefits like subject-specific support, mentoring and networking opportunities. If you're eligible, you can apply directly to the scholarship provider.</p>
  <p>You cannot receive both a bursary and a scholarship.</p>
  <p>Bursaries and scholarships are not available for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>every subject</li>
      <li>salaried teacher training</li>
    </ul>
