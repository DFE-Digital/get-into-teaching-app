<p>You may be eligible for a teaching bursary or scholarship when training to teach. These are tax-free amounts of money you receive to train in certain subjects. You do not need to pay them back.</p>

<p>Scholarships are offered by independent institutions. They set their own eligibility criteria and you’ll need to apply through the relevant scholarship body.</p>

<p>You do not need to apply for a bursary. If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically receive it.</p>

<p>Figures are for courses starting in the 2023/24 academic year.</p>
