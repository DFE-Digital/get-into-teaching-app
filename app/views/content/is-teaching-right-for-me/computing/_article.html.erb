<p>Teaching computing you'll help pupils become responsible and confident users of information and technology.</p>
<p>In an increasingly digital world, you could inspire pupils to look at a future role in technology. With roles in technology making up 14% of all job opportunities in the UK.</p>

<h2>What you'll be teaching</h2>
<p>At GCSE and A level you'll teach computer science. You will teach themes from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study">national curriculum</a>, with opportunities to develop your pupils' computational thinking.  </p>
<p>When teaching 11 to 14 year olds (key stage 3), you could use interactive exercises during your lessons, like creating a robot car. Themes you might also cover are:  </p>
<ul class="vertical-tags">
<li class="tag">Algorithms</li>
<li class="tag">Programming and debugging</li>
<li class="tag">Creative projects</li>
<li class="tag">Use of logical reasoning</li>
<li class="tag">Computer systems</li>
<li class="tag">Uses of technology</li>
<li class="tag">Online safety </li>
</ul>
<p>When teaching 14 to 16 year olds (key stage 4) computer science as a GCSE qualification. You'll teach pupils how to understand how changes in technology affect safety, including new ways to protect
their online privacy and identity. Themes you might also cover are:</p>
<ul class="vertical-tags">
<li class="tag">Computational thinking</li>
<li class="tag">Digital media and information technology</li>
<li class="tag">Computer networks</li>
<li class="tag">Cyber security</li>
<li class="tag">Data representation</li>
<li class="tag">Digital technology</li>
</ul>
<p>For 16 to 18 year olds (key stage 5), you'll teach computer science as a A level qualification and encourage pupils to develop skills to develop websites and prepare them for further learning or employment. Themes you might also cover are:</p>
<ul class="vertical-tags">
<li class="tag">Abstraction</li>
<li class="tag">Writing programmes to solve problems</li>
<li class="tag">Efficiency of algorithms</li>
<li class="tag">Data structures and the use of databases</li>
<li class="tag">Systems architecture</li>
<li class="tag">Computing related mathematics</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-s">Funding for training to teach computing</h2>
<p>To train to be a computing teacher, you'll need to do a teacher training course.</p>
<p><a href="/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries">Tax-free bursaries of £28,000 and scholarships of £30,000 are available for eligible trainee computing teachers</a>.</p>
<p>You can receive this alongside a tuition fee and maintenance loan.</p>
<p>You may also be able to get extra funding support if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a parent or carer</li>
<li>disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-UK citizens without indefinite leave to remain in the UK are unlikely to be eligible for funding.</p>
<h2 class="heading-s">Check your qualifications</h2>
<p>You'll need a bachelors degree before training to teach and it can be in any subject.</p>
<p> Besides computing, the most popular degrees people have before doing a teacher training course in computing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>computer science</li>
<li>information technology</li>
<li>computer games design</li>
<li>software engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>To train to teach in primary and secondary schools in England, you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>GCSEs at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths (and science if you want to teach primary)</li>
<li>a bachelor’s degree in any subject</li>
</ul>
<p>Your training provider may need you to brush up on your computing knowledge before you become a computing teacher. You can do a <a href="/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement">subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course</a> before you start your teacher training to top up your subject knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="/is-teaching-right-for-me/qualifications-you-need-to-teach">Find out more about the qualifications needed to teach</a>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-s">Paid internship </h2>
<p>If you’re currently doing an undergraduate or master's degree and are interested in teaching computing, you could apply for a <a href="/is-teaching-right-for-me/teaching-internship-providers">paid teaching internship</a>.</p>
<p>The 3-week programme could help you to understand what it’s really like in the classroom and get a feel for school life.</p>
<p>You can also find out what it's like to be in a classroom through unpaid <a href="/is-teaching-right-for-me/get-school-experience">school experience</a>.</p>
