  <p>
  If you're an engineer or material scientist, an engineers teach physics initial teacher training course could be a great start to your teaching journey.
  </p>
  <p>
  Continue your engineering career by getting into the classroom and use your skills and passion to inspire the next generation.
  <p>
  We need more physics teachers. Without them children are missing out on the opportunity to develop their understanding of the world around them. Engineers bring a unique and innovative perspective into the physics classroom, helping to explain big things to young minds.
  <p> 
  We want to train a diverse range of physics teachers who can pass on their knowledge in exciting and interesting ways to inspire the engineers of the future.</p>
