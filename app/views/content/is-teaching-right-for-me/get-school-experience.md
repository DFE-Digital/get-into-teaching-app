navigation_title: How do I get experience in a school?
navigation_description: Spending some time in a school can help you understand if teaching is right for you and give you experience to talk about in your application.

You can visit schools to get unpaid experience in the classroom before you start your initial teacher training (ITT).

It can help you:

- decide if you want to train to be a teacher
- discover if you’d like to teach in primary or secondary school
- build a relationship with a school you might want to work for later

## What to expect

Your experience will either be in a school or joining classes and meeting teachers online. Placements usually last one or 2 days, but some can last up to 3 weeks.

During your experience, you’ll get to do things like:

- observe lessons
- see how teachers manage a classroom
- find out how specific subjects are taught
- speak to teachers and meet pupils
- learn more about teacher training - including the application and interview process

## Find school experience

You can search for and request [school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/) in England.

If you can’t find what you’re looking for, you can call a school directly. You can [find schools near you](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) and ask who to talk to about getting school experience.

They may ask you to have a DBS check before attending.

## Other ways to get experience of the classroom

### Teaching internships

A paid teaching internship could help you to understand what it’s really like in the classroom if you’re currently studying for an undergraduate or master's degree and are interested in teaching:

- chemistry
- computing
- languages
- maths
- physics

You’ll get to experience a range of activities to help you get a feel for school life.

[Find out more about paid teaching internships](/is-teaching-right-for-me/teaching-internship-providers).

### Watch pre-recorded lessons

You can [observe teachers’ lessons](https://teachers.thenational.academy/lessons-for-itt) on the Oak National Academy website to help you get to know teaching better, before or alongside your ITT.
