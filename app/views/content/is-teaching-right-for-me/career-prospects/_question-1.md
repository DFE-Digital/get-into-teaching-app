**Fran:** Your career progression can vary vastly depending on where you’re located, your employer and your training experience. For example, you might decide in your training period to set your targets in a particular area such as Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), or you might work in a sixth-form environment. And that can sway where your future takes you.
 
**Sian:** When I worked at a local authority primary state school it was quite traditional in terms of class teacher, head of year, deputy/assistant then head. When I moved to a headship in an academy trust there was no deputy head. So you might not always go into a school that has a traditional structure. There’s not always a neat pathway.

**Chris:** People may not realise there is much progression they think they go into the world of the classroom and that’s it. Lots of teachers have added responsibilities they enjoy doing and find fulfilling.
