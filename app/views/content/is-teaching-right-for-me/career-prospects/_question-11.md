**Fran:** Teaching helps anybody. You can be thrown into a unique situation every day in a classroom. A good teacher can recognise if they continue developing and learning and follow the theory side of education and for example, continue reading, it’s always going to empower you as an individual. Regardless of where you end up working. Teaching has allowed me to look at the theories behind education, the psychology and sociology, which I’d never have done had I not been a teacher.
