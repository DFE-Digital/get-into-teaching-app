**Fran:** A Teaching Learning Responsibility (TLR) is a good way to test the water and see if you can deal with the demands of a more senior role. It can give you an opportunity to do a fixed term and see how you feel with the pressure of it. For example, if you were taking on a literary or special educational needs (SEN) responsibility. To get a TLR you've got to have a proven track record. You need to show you’ve got good relationships with your classes. Your teaching has to be consistently solid and you’ve got to get decent results. And that does take time. 

**Elaine:** I was ready after six years of teaching for leadership. I tried to take the next step from head of faculty to assistant head but I couldn't get interviewed. So I applied for deputy headships, which was the role above, and was offered every job. Because I'd done a masters I was over-ready for the next step was leapfrogged. So you can't put years on it. I think you know when you know.
