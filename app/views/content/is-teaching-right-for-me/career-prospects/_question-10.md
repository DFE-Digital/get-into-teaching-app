**Chris:** If you want to go into senior leadership in a secondary school youâ€™ll need to build both a curriculum role and a pastoral role, for example, head of geography and head of house, into your early career. 

**Elaine:** I've got curriculum and pastoral experience and I also did school timetabling. As a head you need experience of everything to get to the top.
