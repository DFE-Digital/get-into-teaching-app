**Fran:** Once you're training has finished, it's not about other people, it's about how you direct your career. You have to carve out your own journey and make it your own. Lots of people expect to be told what they’ll do in teaching, when they’ll do it and how to progress.  

**Chris:** Promotion in teaching won't come and find you. You go and look for it. Traditionally it used to be based on length of service. But people I've known who have become secondary school deputy heads and head teachers in recent years have gone into teaching with a plan. They sought things proactively and put themselves forward to bring themselves to the attention of leaders and build their CV within the schools. Although opportunities can find you if you're in one of the high demand areas, because just as there's a shortage of classroom physics teachers, that's also reflected in a shortage of heads of physics.
