**Sian:** You have to be prepared to work pretty hard and take on an area. It might involve extra work but you have to look at the bigger picture. I went into teaching, left for 12 years and went back in and thought now I want to climb the career ladder. I led on phonics which then led into English. And that enabled me to move on.
