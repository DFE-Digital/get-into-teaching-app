**Sian:** You have to be prepared to work pretty hard and take on an area. It might involve extra work but you have to look at the bigger picture. I went into teaching, left for 12 years and went back in and thought now I want to climb the career ladder. I led on phonics which then led into English. And that enabled me to move on. 

I remember going through an Ofsted with phonics. I knew the phonics needed improvement and it was horrible experience. But it was something I had to go through to then go on the journey to make it better and show what I was able to do.
