<h2>Check your qualifications</h2>
<p>You'll need a bachelors degree before training to teach, but it does not have to be in maths.</p>
<p>Maths teacher training courses have had successful applications from candidates with a range of degrees, including psychology, music, architecture and law.</p>
<p>Your training provider may need you to brush up on your computing knowledge before you become a maths teacher. You can do a <a href="/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement">subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course</a> before you start your teacher training to top up your subject knowledge. </p>

<p>If you’re currently doing an undergraduate or master's degree and are interested in teaching computing, you could apply for a <a href="/is-teaching-right-for-me/teaching-internship-providers">paid teaching internship</a>.</p>
<p>The 3-week programme could help you to understand what it’s really like in the classroom and get a feel for school life.</p>
