<h2>Fund your teacher training</h2>
<p><a href="/funding-and-support/scholarships-and-bursaries">Tax-free bursaries of £28,000 and scholarships of £30,000 are available for eligible trainee maths teachers</a>. </p>
<p>You can receive this alongside a tuition fee and maintenance loan. </p>
<p>You may also be able to get <a href="/funding-and-support">extra funding support</a> if you are: </p>
<ul>
<li>a parent or carer </li>
<li>disabled </li>
</ul>
<p>Non-UK citizens without indefinite leave to remain in the UK are unlikely to be eligible for funding.</p>
<h2>Check your qualifications</h2>
<p>You'll need a bachelors degree before training to teach, but it does not have to be in maths.</p>
<p>Besides maths, the most popular degrees people have before doing a teacher training course in maths are:</p>
<ul>
<li>economics </li>
<li>psychology </li>
<li>accounting </li>
<li>mechanical engineering </li>
</ul>

<p>Your training provider may need you to brush up on your computing knowledge before you become a maths teacher. You can do a <a href="/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/subject-knowledge-enhancement">subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course</a> before you start your teacher training to top up your subject knowledge. </p>

<h2>Paid internship</h2>
<p>If you’re currently doing an undergraduate or master's degree and are interested in teaching computing, you could apply for a <a href="/is-teaching-right-for-me/teaching-internship-providers">paid teaching internship</a>.</p>
<p>The 3-week programme could help you to understand what it’s really like in the classroom and get a feel for school life.</p>
<p>You can also find out what it's like to be in a classroom through <a href="is-teaching-right-for-me/get-school-experience">unpaid school experience</a>.</p>
