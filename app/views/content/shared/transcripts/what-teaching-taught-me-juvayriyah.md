My name is Juvayriyah. I teach maths and I’m in my sixth year of teaching. Ended up choosing my degree in maths, knew that I wanted to go into teaching, so started having a look at PGCE courses. Within the first couple of weeks of you starting, you do go straight into the classroom.

When I first started teaching, I would probably say that I was really nervous. In terms of my confidence, it has grown astronomically. I started a new role as key stage three coordinator in maths, running things like the curriculum.

Recently, I got the opportunity to take a group of girls to a maths competition. It was all about encouraging girls in STEM. It was amazing to see how much they loved the competition and how rewarding it was for them.

Being a female teacher but teaching maths is really, really important. You can flourish. You watch others improve. It’s so, so fulfilling. Maths is great. Maths is so cool. The world revolves around maths, and we need more people to show how important it is.
