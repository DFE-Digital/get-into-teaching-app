My name’s Josh. I teach science, specifically biology. I did want to be a physiotherapist, went through university, soon realised that it wasn’t for me. I went into a school and then it just clicked straight away.

My confidence has grown outside of school, partially because of teaching, because you understand who you are more.

Working with students with special educational needs, of which I am and was one of those students. Helping me understand my deafness, teaching my students sign and what it’s like to be someone that’s deaf. I ask a whole class to answer in a sign letter or a sign word. It really helps and informs your practice.

After a couple of years, I became a deputy head of year, which is a pastoral responsibility. After a year of that, I then became a head of year. My school has over 1,400 students in it. To be a leader in the leadership team of that school, the impact you can have is huge. That’s the next step that I’m taking.
