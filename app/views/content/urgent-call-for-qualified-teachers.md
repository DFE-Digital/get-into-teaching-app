Are you a qualified teacher not currently working the sector? 
Please support children and help schools stay open

Thank you for helping your teaching colleagues and the nation’s children and learners, through some difficult months ahead. 

Your support as a qualified teacher will help schools and colleges stay open and give children and learners the support they need. 

## Who can help?

We’re inviting qualified teachers from primary, secondary and further education to step in and help teach our children and young people on a temporary basis. You may retired, taking time off to care for children or others, or currently working in a different area, for example. 

## What’s required?

Your time will be invaluable, whatever you can spare - whether it is one day a week or five. You will be helping secure children and young people’s education. 


## Please register with a supply agency now

This will enable the agencies to be ready to use you from the new year.
