Are you a qualified teacher not currently working in the sector?
We are asking for your help to support your teaching colleagues and the nation's children and young people through this difficult time.

Covid continues to impact schools and colleges in England. We want to make sure that as many supply staff as possible are available in the new year.

## Who can help?

We're inviting qualified ex-teachers from primary, secondary and further education to step in and help teach children and young people in school and college on a temporary basis. You may be retired, taking time off to care for children or others, or currently working in a different area, but you may be able to spare some time to help.

## What's required?

Your time will be invaluable, whatever you can spare - whether it is one day a week or five. You will be helping protect children and young people's education.

## Please register with a supply teaching agency now

This will enable an agency to be ready to use you as soon as possible.

You can use any supply teaching agency you choose. You might, for example, have
worked through an agency before or know which agencies local schools use. 

You can also find a supply teaching agency from the list below. These supply
agencies are part of the government framework and offer schools value for
money.

Please contact agencies directly. They will help you with what you need, for
example updating your DBS.
