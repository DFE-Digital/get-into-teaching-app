Teacher training in England is practical, hands-on and supportive. You’ll have the opportunity to train at a world class institution where creativity and innovation is valued, gaining lots of classroom experience along the way. You’ll leave with qualified teacher status (QTS), a professional qualification valued globally. 

You can apply to train to teach in England from any country in the world. 

You can also apply to train to teach in [Wales](https://educators.wales/home), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).



### 1. Check your qualifications

To start postgraduate teacher training in England, you need:

#### A university degree

Your degree can be from outside the UK.

If you do not have a degree yet, you can apply to an [undergraduate teacher training course](https://www.ucas.com/postgraduate/teacher-training/train-teach-england/undergraduate-teacher-training-england) instead of a postgraduate course.

#### English and maths qualifications

You will need the equivalent of a GCSE (grade 4) in English and maths.

To teach children aged 3 to 11, you also need the equivalent of a GCSE (grade 4) in a science subject.

#### We can help if you have international qualifications
 
If your qualifications come from a non-UK institution, your teacher training provider may want to see a ‘[statement of comparability](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx)’ showing their equivalence to UK qualifications.

Call us on [0800 389 2500](tel://08003892500) for:

* guidance on the UK equivalents of your qualifications
* a free statement of comparability detailing overseas degree equivalency from UK ENIC once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this

### 2. Get a teacher training adviser

You can get an adviser for one-to-one support. They can give you practical advice and guidance at every stage of your application.

### 3. Learn about financial support

Fees are usually higher for international trainees but you may be able to [get financial support](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants#financial-support-for-non-uk-applicants-for-unsalaried-teacher-training-in-england).


### 4. Choose a training provider and get an offer to train

Contact your [Get into teaching adviser](/tta-service) for guidance on the different types of courses available. You can choose between a fee-paying course, or one which pays a salary. You can also train in a school or in a university setting, and study full-time (over a year) or part-time (over 2 or more years).  

[Learn more about ways to train to teach in England.](/ways-to-train)

[Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses) lets you search for teacher training courses in England by location, teaching subject and age group. You can also search for courses which pay a salary, and courses which can sponsor a visa.  

Contact providers before you apply to get their advice about eligibility and the application process.

You will be able to apply for a teacher training place without visiting the UK. Some providers also conduct interviews using remote technology – check with your provider when you apply. 

#### Your suitability for teaching

Your training provider will check you’re suitable for teaching in terms of your health, whether you're safe to work with children and your level of maths and English.

### 5. Apply for the right visa or status

You need to [get the right visa or status to study in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants#visas-and-immigration).

You usually need a confirmed offer on a course to apply for a visa.

[If you're an Irish citizen you do not need a visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance).
