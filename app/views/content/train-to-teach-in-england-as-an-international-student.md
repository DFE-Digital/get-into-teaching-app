Teacher training in England is practical, hands-on and supportive. As an international applicant, you’ll have the opportunity to train at a world class institution where creativity and innovation is valued, gaining lots of classroom experience along the way. You’ll leave with qualified teacher status (QTS), a professional qualification valued globally.

You can apply to train to teach in England from any country in the world. This page explains how, step by step.

You can also apply to train to teach in [Wales](https://educators.wales/home), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).

### Already a qualified teacher?
Visit [Come to England to teach if you're a teacher from outside the UK](/come-to-england-to-teach-if-you-are-a-teacher-from-outside-the-uk) to learn more.

## 1. Check your qualifications

To teach children aged 11 to 18 in secondary school, you’ll need:

* a bachelor’s degree (this can be from a university outside the UK)
* a standard in English and mathematics equivalent to a grade 4 GCSE

To teach children aged 3 to 11 in primary school, you will also need to meet a standard in physics, chemistry or biology equivalent to a grade 4 GCSE.

A GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16. [Get help understanding GCSEs, other English qualifications and their international equivalents.]<a href="#2.-Get-help-and-advice">Get help understanding GCSEs, other English qualifications and their international equivalents.</a>

### If you do not have a university degree
If you do not have a degree, you can [apply to study a 3 to 4 year undergraduate course in England](https://www.ucas.com/teaching-in-the-uk) which combines a teaching degree with a professional teaching qualification ([qualified teacher status, or QTS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts)). When you complete your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.

Visit the [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/) for lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.

## 2. Get help and advice

### Help with international qualifications

If your qualifications come from a non-UK institution, your teacher training provider may want to see a [‘statement of comparability’](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx) showing their equivalence to UK qualifications.

Call Get into Teaching on 0800 389 2500 for:

* guidance on the UK equivalents of your qualifications
* a free statement of comparability detailing overseas degree equivalency from UK ENIC once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this

### Get an adviser
You can also register with our Get an adviser service for personalised advice about teaching in England over email, phone or online chat.

## 3. Find out about financial support

Course fees for international students on fee-paying teacher training courses are usually  between £11,000 and £16,000 – costs vary, so check with individual providers for more information.

Most international students will not be eligible for financial support.

You can also apply for a salaried teacher training course, when you’ll earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are competitive and you will usually need to have achieved highly in your bachelor’s degree and have at least 3 years’ relevant work experience.

### Already living in the UK?

You may be eligible to get financial support with your teacher training course if you:

• have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme

• don’t fall under the EU Settlement Scheme, but have settled status, for example indefinite leave to remain

## 4. Search and apply for teacher training courses

Visit [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) for teacher training courses in England leading to qualified teacher status (QTS). You can search by location, teaching subject and age group. You can also search for courses which pay a salary, and courses where visa sponsorship is available.

### Ways to train

You can train in a school or in a university setting, and study full-time (over a year) or part-time (over 2 or more years). Contact your [Get into teaching adviser](2.-Get-help-and-advice) for guidance on the different types of courses available, or see [Ways to train to teach in England](/ways-to-train).

You can apply for a teacher training place without visiting the UK, and some providers also conduct interviews using remote technology. Due to rules about immigration, not all providers can accept international applicants – contact them before you apply to check.

### Already living in the UK?

If you have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, or indefinite leave to remain, you can apply to any teacher training provider in England.

### Your suitability for teaching

As part of the application process, your training provider will check you’re suitable for teaching in terms of your health, whether you’re safe to work with children and your level of maths and English.

## 5. Apply for your visa

You will need a visa or an alternative immigration status allowing you to train as a teacher in the UK.

## Already living in the UK?

If you have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), or indefinite leave to remain, you will not need a visa to train to teach in the UK.

Some people can still apply for settled or pre-settled status – check your eligibility.

If you are currently studying in the UK on a student visa, you may be able to apply for a graduate visa.

If you don’t already have an immigration status allowing you to train to teach in the UK, you’ll need to apply for a student visa, once you have a confirmed offer of a fee-paying training place from a training provider who can sponsor visas. If you have a place on a salaried training course, you’ll need a skilled worker visa.

Alternatively, you may be eligible for a different type of visa which allows you to study without being sponsored by your training provider or employer.

## 6. Plan your move to the UK

The [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/Information--Advice) delivers independent advice about all aspects of the international student experience, including immigration, finding a place to live and opening a bank account. Their [Student Advice Line](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/About-UKCISA/Contact-us#:~:text=For%20anything%20urgent%2C%20please%20call%20our%20switchboard%20on,from%20immigration%20and%20fees%20through%20to%20mental%20health) also offers support over the phone.

Your teacher training provider may also be able to help you plan your move to the UK  – contact them directly to ask.


## 7. Complete your teacher training and gain qualified teacher status (QTS)

If you’re accepted on to an English teacher training course, you’ll train for one year (or longer if you’re part-time) to gain [QTS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).

## 8. Apply for your first teaching job

When you have qualified teacher status, you will be able to apply for paid teaching jobs in all schools in England.

You may need to apply for a different visa to work in England as a qualified teacher. Our [guidance for non-UK nationals wishing to teach in England](updated url) explains the skilled worker visa and covers other ways you can update, extend or switch your visa when you finish your training.
