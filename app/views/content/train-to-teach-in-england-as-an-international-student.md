Citizens of every country in the world can apply to train to teach in England.

If you're already a qualified teacher, find out how you can [teach in England if you completed your teacher training outside the UK.](/come-to-england-to-teach-if-you-are-a-teacher-from-outside-the-uk)

## Why train to teach in England?

Teacher training in England is practical, hands-on and supportive. As an international applicant, you’ll have the opportunity to train at a world class institution where creativity and innovation is valued, gaining lots of classroom experience along the way.

When you have successfully completed your training, you will be awarded [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts), a professional qualification valued globally.

QTS will allow you to teach in all schools in England. Some courses combine QTS with a [postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)](/what-is-a-pgce) or a [postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE)](/what-is-a-pgce). These are optional, you can get QTS without a PGCE or PGDE.

[Read teachers' stories about the rewards of training to teach in England](/my-story-into-teaching).

## Other ways to train

You can also apply to train to teach in [Wales](https://educators.wales/home), [Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/initial-teacher-education-courses-northern-ireland).

If you don’t want to come to England to study you can apply to train for international qualified teacher status (iQTS), which meets the same high standards as [English qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) and leads to the automatic award of QTS. [Learn more about iQTS.](/international-qualified-teacher-status)

For teachers who qualified outside the UK, as well as those with teaching experience, [other routes to qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk) are also open.

## Need to know

When you plan your training, bear in mind that:

* international candidates can expect to pay between £12,000 and £22,000, plus
living costs, to train (depending on your immigration status, you may get a reduction in fees and some financial support)
* training lasts one 1 academic year full-time, or longer part-time
* you can apply for paid teaching jobs as soon as you successfully complete your training
* you'll earn at least £25,000 a year, and £32,000 in London, when you qualify as a teacher
* you can update, extend or switch your visa to live and work in the UK long-term

## Apply for teacher training, step by step

We can help you make a successful application for teacher training in England.

### 1. Check your qualifications

To teach children aged 11 to 18 in secondary school, you’ll need:

* a bachelor’s degree (this can be from a university outside the UK)
* to meet a standard in English and maths equivalent to a grade 4 GCSE

To teach children aged 3 to 11 in primary school, you will also need to meet a standard in physics, chemistry or biology equivalent to a grade 4 GCSE.

A GCSE is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16. [We can help you show your English, maths and science qualifications are the same standard as a grade 4 GCSE](#get-support-and-advice).

If you do not have qualifications that are equivalent to GCSEs, you may be able to sit a test set by training providers to show your knowledge of English, maths and science. [You can contact us for advice about this](#get-support-and-advice).

#### If you do not have a university degree

If you don't have a degree, you can [apply to study a 3 to 4 year undergraduate course in England](https://www.ucas.com/postgraduate/teacher-training/applying-teacher-training/find-teacher-training-programmes) which combines a teaching degree with [qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) (QTS). When you complete your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.

The [UK Council for International Student Affairs](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/) have lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.

### 2. Get support and advice

To get advice about training to teach, you can:

* call 0800 389 2500 for free from anywhere in the world, Monday to Friday between 8:30am and 5:30pm (UK local time)
* use the live chat service at the bottom of this page
* sign up to [get an adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) – you’ll be asked for your phone number, email and location so a teacher training adviser can call you back in your time zone

#### Get help with international qualifications

If your qualifications come from a non-UK institution, your teacher training provider may want to see a ‘statement of comparability’ from [UK ENIC](https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx). A statement of comparability proves that your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK undergraduate degree.

Call us free on 0800 389 2500 for:

* guidance on the UK equivalents of your qualifications
* a free statement of comparability, once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this
* advice about what to do if you do not have English, maths and science qualifications of grade 4 GCSE standard

### 3. Find out about fees and financial support

Fees vary between training providers, but range from about £12,000 to about £22,000 in total. You’ll also have to pay your living costs.

Alternatively, you can apply for a salaried teacher training course, and earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive. You will usually need to have achieved highly in your bachelor’s degree and have at least 3 years’ relevant work experience.

#### Financial support

Any financial support, for example a reduction in your fees to the rate paid by UK applicants (set at a maximum of £9,250) is dependent on your immigration status. Most international candidates will not be eligible for financial support.

<div class="inset">
  <h4>Already living in the UK?</h4>

  <p>You may be eligible to get financial support with your teacher training course if you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>have settled or pre-settled status under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a></li>
    <li>don’t fall under the EU Settlement Scheme, but have settled status, for example <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a></li>

### 4. Search and apply for teacher training courses

You can [find postgraduate teacher training courses](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses) in England leading to [qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) (QTS).

You can search by location, teaching subject and age group. You can also search for courses which pay a salary, and courses where student or skilled worker visa sponsorship is available.

If you need a visa to train to teach in England, you must have a confirmed offer of a training place on a course offering student or skilled worker visa sponsorship before you apply for your visa.

Due to rules about immigration, not all providers can accept international applicants – contact them before you apply to check.

#### Ways to train

You can train in a school or in a university setting, and study full-time (over a year) or part-time (over 2 or more years). [Talk to an adviser](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) about the different types of courses available, or explore [how to train to be a teacher in England](/train-to-be-a-teacher).

You may also wish to read [detailed guidance about fee-paying and salaried courses and qualified teacher status](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen#train).

  </p>
</div>

#### Your suitability for teaching

As part of the application process, your training provider will confirm you’re suitable for teaching. They'll check:

* your health and physical capacity to train to teach

* whether you’re safe to work with children (you'll need to undergo safeguarding and criminal record checks)

* the standards you meet in English, maths and, if you want to teach primary school age children, science

You can also [contact UK Visas and Immigration for help](https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk).

[Teaching advisers](https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/) will not be able to answer specific questions about visas and immigration related to your personal circumstances.

  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a>
  you will not need a visa to train to teach in the UK.</p>

</div>

If you don’t already have an immigration status allowing you to train to teach in the UK, you’ll need to apply for a [student visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen#visa). You can do this once you have a confirmed offer of a training place from a training provider who can sponsor student visas.

If you have a place on a salaried training course, you’ll need a [skilled worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/train-to-teach-in-england-non-uk-applicants/train-to-teach-in-england-if-youre-a-non-uk-citizen#visa).

Alternatively, you may be eligible for a different type of visa which allows you to study without being sponsored by your training provider or employer.

### 6. Plan your move to the UK

Their [Student Advice Line](https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/About-UKCISA/Contact-us) also offers support over the phone.

Your teacher training provider may also be able to help you plan your move to the UK  – contact them directly to ask.


### 7. Complete your teacher training and gain qualified teacher status (QTS)

If you’re accepted on to a teacher training course in England, you’ll train for one year (or longer if you’re part-time) to gain [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts).

You may need to apply for a different visa to work in England as a qualified teacher. Our [guidance for non-UK nationals wishing to teach in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk) explains the skilled worker visa and covers other ways you can update, extend or switch your visa when you finish your training.

### 8. Apply for your first teaching job

When you have qualified teacher status, you will be able to apply for paid teaching jobs in all schools in England.
