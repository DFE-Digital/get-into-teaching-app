At the end of your training, your iQTS provider and school will assess you to check you meet iQTS [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-teachers-standards). 

Your training provider will award you international qualified teacher status (iQTS) when you have successfully passed this assessment process. You will then be automatically awarded [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) by England’s Department for Education.
