Your iQTS provider will assess you throughout your training to check you meet iQTS [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-teachers-standards). Passing your training provider's assessment gives you international qualified teacher status. If you wish, you can then apply to England's Department for Education for qualified teacher status (QTS). You can apply for QTS even if you don’t want to teach in England.
