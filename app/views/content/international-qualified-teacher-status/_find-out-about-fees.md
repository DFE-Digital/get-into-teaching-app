Fees start at about £9,000 in total but will vary between training providers – check with participating iQTS training providers (listed in step 3) for more details.

If you are already employed in a school, you can discuss with your training provider whether you can continue working in that school while you complete your iQTS qualification.  

You might be able to get a salary for your work in a placement school – this will vary between schools and between providers. 

To learn more, contact your chosen iQTS provider directly.
