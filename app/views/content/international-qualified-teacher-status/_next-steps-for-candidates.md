#### Apply for QTS

When you have successfully completed your iQTS training, you can apply to England’s Department for Education for QTS. You can do this without further fees or training. 

#### Apply for your teaching job and visa

You can apply for teaching jobs in England using the [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/) service.

To work in England you’ll also need a visa. You will usually need to find a job before you apply for a visa.

#### Complete your induction

As a newly qualified teacher, you’ll find some schools in England will require you to complete a 2-year induction period. During this time you’ll work and earn a salary as a teacher, and be assessed as part of DfE’s [Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework). You’ll be expected to show you meet English [Teachers’ Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) and you’ll also benefit from training and mentoring.

You can complete your induction in a relevant school in England (see [Induction for early career teachers (England), para 2.1](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972316/Statutory_Induction_Guidance_2021_final__002_____1___1_.pdf)) or a [DfE-accredited British School Overseas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#stat).
