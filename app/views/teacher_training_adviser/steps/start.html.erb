<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Get an adviser</h1>
<p>If you’re thinking about teaching in England, an adviser can provide free, one-to-one support through phone, text or email. You can talk to them as little or as much as needed.</p>
<p>All our advisers have years of teaching experience and can help you whether you’re just thinking about teaching, or you’re ready to get back into the classroom.</p>
<p>Your adviser can help you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>get school experience</li>
  <li>discover what teaching is really like</li>
  <li>write your personal statement</li>
  <li>find out how to improve your subject knowledge</li>
  <li>understand the qualifications you need</li>
  <li>find a teaching role</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can get an adviser?</h2>
<p>You'll need to have or be studying for a bachelor's degree in any subject to get an adviser. If you already have a degree, it needs to be a 2:2 or higher.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about returning to teaching, you'll need to have qualified teacher status (QTS) and want to teach a secondary subject in England to get an adviser.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-UK trainees</h2>
<p>To get an adviser, you'll need to have or be studying for an overseas qualification of the same standard as a UK bachelor’s degree, class 2:2 (honours) or higher.</p>
<p>You can check the UK equivalents of your degree qualifications by calling us on +44 800 389 2500.</p>
