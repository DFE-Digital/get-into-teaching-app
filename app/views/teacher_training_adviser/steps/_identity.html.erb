<h1>Get a free adviser</h1>

<p>
  If you're thinking about teaching in England, an adviser can provide free, one-to-one support by phone,
  text or email. You can talk to them as little or as much as you need.
</p>

<p>
  To sign up you'll need to have, or be studying for, a bachelor's degree with honours. If you already have a degree, it needs to be a grade 2:2 or higher (or an equivalent).
</p>

<p>
  If you got your qualifications outside the UK, call us on <a href="tel:08003892500">0800 389 2500</a> to check if you're eligible.
</p>

<p>
  If you're already a qualified teacher, you'll need English qualified teacher status (QTS), previous experience of teaching in the UK or have trained to teach in the UK.
