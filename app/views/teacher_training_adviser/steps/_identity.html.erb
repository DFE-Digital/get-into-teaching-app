<h1>Get an adviser</h1>

<p>
  If you're thinking about teaching in England, an adviser can provide free, one-to-one support by phone,
  text or email. You can talk to them as little or as much as you need.
</p>

<p>
  To sign up, you'll need to have or be studying for a bachelor's degree, grade 2:2 or higher (or an equivalent).
</p>

<p>
  If you're already a qualified teacher, you'll need English qualified teacher status (QTS) and want to
  teach a secondary subject to be eligible for an adviser.
</p>

<p>
  If you got your qualifications outside the UK, you can call us on <a href="tel:08003892500">0800 389 2500</a> to check if you're eligible.
