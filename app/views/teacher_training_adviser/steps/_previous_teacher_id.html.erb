      How do I find my teacher reference number (TRN)?

  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    Your TRN is sometime on your payslip, pension statement or teacher training records.<br>
    Alternatively, you can find a lost TRN<br><br>
    You'll be asked for your:
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>Date of birth</li>
      <li>National Insurance number</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    If there's a match, you'll get your TRN straight away. If there's no match, or you don't have a National Insurance number, it might take up to 5 days to find your TRN.
