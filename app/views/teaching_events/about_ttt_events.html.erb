    <p>
      Train to Teach events are designed to give you an insight into what it’s
      like to be a teacher, as well as the practical information you need to get
      onto a teacher training course.
    </p>

    <p>
      Events are run by the Department for Education and are impartial. We do
      invite local training providers along to give you an idea of what they
      offer, but our goal is to answer your questions and give you the confidence
      to take your next step.
    </p>

    <p>
      To attend, you need to register. Spaces are limited, so the sooner you sign
      up, the better.
    </p>
