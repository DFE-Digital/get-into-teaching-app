## Plan
Disaster Recover (DR) follows the principles outlined in the [Becoming a Teacher  Disaster recovery plan](https://dfedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BaT/pages/2921365676/Disaster+recovery).

## Specific to Get Into Teaching
There is no persistant data stored in Get Into Teaching, and therefore there is no requirment to carry out a restore. 
In the event of a total failure a delivery to the system will rebuild what is necessary, via the terraform deployments.
