        we are\nThis work is being carried out by the Department for Education (DfE).
        For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller
        for the personal data processed as part of The Get Into Teaching Information
        Service, including the Get School Experience service.\nHow we will use your
        information\nWe receive and process the personal data you provided when completing
        either the Get Into Teaching registration form or the Get School Experience
        service registration form, because you have requested that we provide you
        with tailored advice and information about teacher training and a career as
        a teacher, or have requested school experience. These services will help you
        to make an informed decision about making an application.\n\nSpecifically
        we will use your data in the following ways:\n•\tThe information you provide
        in the registration forms (and any subsequent updates made via our helpline,
        including registration to events) is shared with our Get Into Teaching telephone
        helpline and web chat service to ensure that they have an accurate picture
        of your circumstances in order to provide a tailored service and information
        to you. Any subsequent information you provide to the helpline will also be
        recorded in order to continue to provide you with a tailored service.\n•\tWe
        use your contact details to communicate with you by telephone and to send
        you email, SMS and postal messages, providing you with information about a
        career in teaching. We may also contact you to gauge your interest in taking
        part in market research. In each message, you will be given the opportunity
        to unsubscribe from further communications.\n•\tThe information we collect
        from you (such as your name, contact details and subject preferences) is used
        for identification, administration, analysis and targeting purposes. This
        allows us to ensure that public funds are being spent effectively.\n•\tWe
        will use anonymised data about you to deliver tailored messages on third party
        platforms, including social media - like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat
        and Google search. Such anonymised data will also be used to identify and
        advertise to people that are similar to you, who may also be interested in
        our service.\n•\tIf you are using the Get School Experience service, your
        data will be used to process your request for school experience with the school(s)
        in question. We will also use it to send out notifications, reminders and
        feedback questionnaires. We track your progress through this service to improve
        it for you and future applicants and to ensure public funds are being spent
        effectively.\nYour personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service,
        will be stored for 5 years.\nIf you do not supply us with your personal information
        then we cannot provide a tailored advice and information service or offer
        you access to the services available via our website such as booking a Train
        to Teach event. However, without registering, you can still access general
        information via the Get into Teaching helpline and website and can complete
        an application for Initial Teacher Training through UCAS Teacher Training.\n\nThe
        nature of your personal data we will be using\nThe categories of your data,
        supplied by you through the registration forms and other interactions with
        us, that we will be using for this service are personal data such as:\n•\tName\n•\tEmail
        address\n•\tAddress\n•\tContact telephone number\n•\tDate of birth\n•\tIP
        Address\nWe will also be collecting non-personal information such as:\n•\tYour
        teaching preferences\n•\tYour intended training commencement year\n•\tYour
        qualifications\n•\tAny additional supplementary information you provide during
        communication with the helpline and/or personal advisers that will help us
        to aid you in progressing your application and continue to improve our service.\n\nWhy
        our use of your personal data is lawful\nIn order for our use of your personal
        data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection
        legislation. You have requested to receive this service and therefore, together
        with this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have agreed
        to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the condition that
        we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the service) is that
        under Article 6 (1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) DfE
        is processing your personal data in the performance of a task carried out
        in the public interest.\nWho we will make your personal data available to\nWe
        share your information with trusted partners working to deliver the service
        under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to continue to provide
        you with relevant information about a career in teaching and teacher training
        or ''the service''. These partners are required to strictly comply with our
        privacy policies that prohibit them using your personal data for any other
        purpose.\n\nWe share certain personal data with UCAS Teacher Training, who
        manage the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal information
        with UCAS Teacher Training enables us to identify those who have applied for
        teacher training, thus enabling us to remove the names of these applicants
        from our mailing lists. We also share data to track your application in order
        to determine the effectiveness of our service, monitor overall levels of teacher
        training applicants and improve it for you and future applicants. \nIf you
        are using the Get School Experience service, we will share some of your personal
        data to the staff who manage school experience at the school where you''ve
        requested school experience. This allows them to process your application
        and get back to you about your school experience. \nHow long we will keep
        your personal data\nYour personal data, supplied for the purposes of this
        service, will be stored for 5 years. We will delete this information if you
        request us to do so.\nYour data protection rights\nYou have the right:\n•\tto
        ask us for access to information about you that we hold\n•\tto have your personal
        data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete\n•\tto request the deletion
        or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued
        processing\n•\tto restrict our processing of your personal data (i.e. permitting
        its storage but no further processing)\n•\tto object to direct marketing (including
        profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research
        and statistics - but this will mean you no longer can receive the service\n\nPlease
        contact us at getintoteaching.helpdesk@education.gov.uk and enter Data Protection
        as a reference regarding any of the rights listed above. For the Data Protection
        Officer (DPO) please contact us via gov.uk and mark it for the attention of
        the ‘DPO’.\nIf you need to contact us regarding any of the above rights, please
        do so via the Get into Teaching site\nFurther information about your data
        protection rights appears on the Information Commissioner''s website\nRight
        to lodge a complaint\nIf you are unhappy with our use of your personal data,
        please let us know by contacting getintoteaching.helpdesk@education.gov.uk\nAlternatively,
        you have the right to raise any concerns with the Information Commissioner''s
        Office (ICO) via their website.\nLast updated\nWe may need to update this
        privacy notice periodically, so we recommend that you revisit this information
        from time to time. This version was last updated on 14 January 2020.\nWe use
